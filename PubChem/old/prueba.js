The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

                      "String": "The relationship between the metabolism and the toxicity of ortho-dichlorobenzene was investigated by evaluating its biotransformation, tissue distribution, blood kinetics and excretion after oral administration of 5, 50 or 250 mg/kg bw to male Wistar rats. The dose of 250 mg/kg bw had been demonstrated to be toxic in previous studies. The major route of elimination of ortho-dichlorobenzene (75-85%) was via the kidneys; excretion in the feces represented 19% of the low dose and 7% of the high dose. Excretion was nearly complete within 24 hr after the low and intermediate doses and within 48 hr after the high dose. Pretreatment with phenobarbital accelerated excretion of the high dose and resulted in an overall higher proportion of urinary excretion. Biliary excretion constituted 50-60% of the dose, indicating significant enterohepatic recirculation. The highest concentrations of radiolabel after a low dose were found in fat, liver and kidney 6 hr after administration; these then declined rapidly. The maximal concentration in blood was reached 6-8 hr after administration of the low and intermediate doses and 24 hr after the high dose. ortho-Dichlorobenzene was detected in blood only during the first 2 hr after administration of 5 mg/kg bw. The major route of biotransformation was via the glutathione pathway, 60% of the urinary metabolites being mercapturic acids; the major metabolites in bile were also conjugates of glutathione. Other major metabolites in urine were the sulfate conjugates of 2,3- and 3,4- dichlorophenol. No significant differences in metabolic profiles were observed with dose. Induction with phenobarbital increased excretion of sulfate conjugates (30% in induced rats, 20% in control rats), the main one being the conjugate of 3,4-dichlorophenol. The mercapturic acids in urine and the glutathione conjugates in bile were epoxide-derived metabolites, and no quinone- or hydroquinone-derived metabolites were observed. A high dose of ortho-dichlorobenzene results in depletion of glutathione, followed by oxidative stress and possibly binding to macromolecules.",

In rats, absorption of 1,2-dichlorobenzene from the gastrointestinal tract was considered complete at doses of 5 and 50 mg/kg bw but incomplete (83% absorption) at 250 mg/kg bw. There are no quantitative data for the dermal and inhalation absorption of 1,2-dichlorobenzene in animals or absorption of the chemical via any route in humans. Studies with rats have shown that 1,2-dichlorobenzene is distributed primarily to the adipose tissue with lesser amounts detected in the kidneys, liver and plasma. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene equivalents were bound to the kidneys, liver and plasma with covalent binding accounting for a substantial proportion of bound material. In particular, ...non-specific covalent binding to the alpha2u-globulin fraction of the rat kidney /was observed/. Several studies have found that the administration of a single dose of 1,2-dichlorobenzene by either the oral, intraperitoneal or intravenous route results in high initial tissue levels of 1,2-dichlorobenzene equivalents. Peak tissue levels occur within 1 and 6 hours, depending on the method of administration, followed by rapid decline thereafter",

After administration of o-DCB to rats, swift decreases were observed in the concentrations of o-DCB in blood, liver, and kidneys, whereas 3,4-DCPSO2Me appeared in blood, liver, kidneys, and adipose tissue. The concentrations of 3,4-DCPSO2Me in the blood and three tissues reached maxima at 24 hr. Both aminopyrine N-demethylase and aniline hydroxylase activities and cytochrome P450 content of hepatic microsomes decreased 24 hr after administration of o-DCB. In contrast, 3,4-DCPSO2Me increased the activities of these enzymes and cytochrome P450 and b5 contents in rat liver microsomes. In both antibiotic-pretreated and bile duct-cannulated rats dosed with o-DCB, the concentrations of 2,3- and 3,4-DCPSO2Mes in blood, liver, kidneys, and adipose tissue were dramatically reduced. These findings suggest that the process of formation of methylsulfonyl metabolites of o-DCB involves biliary secretion of DCPSO2Mes and/or their precursors which will be subjected to metabolism by intestinal microflora. In antibiotic-pretreated rats, the inhibitory effects of o-DCB administration on the activities of aminopyrine- and aniline-metabolizing enzymes and the contents of cytochromes P450 and b5 in hepatic microsomes were greater than those observed in the intact rats. In bile duct-cannulated rats, the decrease in aminopyrine N-demethylase activity after administration of o-DCB was greater than that observed in the intact rats. These findings suggest that the apparent inhibition of drug-metabolizing enzymes by o-DCB is the result of simultaneous contrary effects, namely, the inductive effect of 3,4-DCPSO2Me and the stronger inhibitory effect of an unknown factor(s) on drug-metabolizing enzymes.",

Conjugation of the epoxides with glutathione was predominantly non-enzymatic in rats, whereas in humans conjugation was catalysed almost exclusively by glutathione S-transferases. This difference may be due to formation of a 'non-reactive' 3,4-epoxide by CYP 2E1 in human microsomes: incubation with microsomes that selectively express human CYP 2E1 or with human liver microsomes resulted in the formation of similar amounts of 2,3- and 3,4-dichlorophenol and two glutathione-epoxides in equal amounts. In rat microsomes, one major glutathione-epoxide conjugate was found, with a much higher covalent binding index, particularly for the phenobarbital-induced microsomes. The authors suggested that rat CYP 2B1/2 preferentially oxidizes the 4,5 site of ortho-dichlorobenzene, while human CYP 2E1 forms predominantly the 'non-reactive' 3,4-epoxide. They concluded that the risk for liver toxicity due to exposure to 1,2-dichlorobenzene will be overestimated when it is based solely on toxicity in rats.",

The rate of conversion was 0.09 nmol/min per mg protein in both Wistar and Fischer 344 rat microsomes, 0.04 in Sprague-Dawley microsomes and 0.14 in human microsomes. Induction of Wistar rats with isoniazid, a CYP 2E1 inducer, or phenobarbital, a CYP 2B1/2 inducer, resulted in increased conversion rates of 0.20 and 0.42 nmol/min per mg protein, respectively. Covalent binding of radiolabel to microsomal proteins was similar in Wistar, Fischer and isoniazid-treated Wistar rats (16-17% of total metabolites), whereas induction with phenobarbital resulted in a slightly increased covalent binding rate of 23% of total metabolites. The covalent binding rate was 31% in Sprague-Dawley microsomes but only 4.6% in human microsomes. Ascorbic acid reduced covalent binding only in Sprague-Dawley microsomes, indicating that quinones are probably major contributors to macromolecular binding in these microsomes. Conjugation of epoxides with glutathione inhibited most covalent binding in all microsomes. In the absence of glutathione, the epoxides were hydrolysed by epoxide hydrolase to dihydrodiols, and inhibition of epoxide hydrolase increased the covalent binding for all microsomes tested, indicating a role of epoxides in the covalent binding. The finding that Fischer 344 rat liver microsomes had less epoxide hydrolase activity than microsomes from Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats may explain the greater sensitivity of rats of this strain to the hepatotoxicity of ortho-dichlorobenzene in vivo. Conjugation of the epoxides with glutathione was predominantly non-enzymatic in rats, whereas in humans conjugation was catalysed almost exclusively by glutathione S-transferases. This difference may be due to formation of a 'non-reactive' 3,4-epoxide by CYP 2E1 in human microsomes: incubation with microsomes that selectively express human CYP 2E1 or with human liver microsomes resulted in the formation of similar amounts of 2,3- and 3,4-dichlorophenol and two glutathione-epoxides in equal amounts. In rat microsomes, one major glutathione-epoxide conjugate was found, with a much higher covalent binding index, particularly for the phenobarbital-induced microsomes. The authors suggested that rat CYP 2B1/2 preferentially oxidizes the 4,5 site of ortho-dichlorobenzene, while human CYP 2E1 forms predominantly the 'non-reactive' 3,4-epoxide. They concluded that the risk for liver toxicity due to exposure to 1,2-dichlorobenzene will be overestimated when it is based solely on toxicity in rats.",

Two oxidative events in the liver contribute to 1,2-DCB-induced liver injury: an initial hepatocellular oxidative stress, followed by oxidant stress associated with an inflammatory response. We hypothesize that the initial hepatocellular oxidative event triggers molecular and cellular processes within hepatocytes that lead to the production of factors that contribute to Kupffer cell (KC) activation and upregulation of the inflammatory cascade. To investigate the molecular effects of 1,2-DCB, primary cultures of Fischer-344 (F-344) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat hepatocytes were incubated with 1,2-DCB (3.6-12.4 umol) and examined for enhanced DNA-binding activity of the oxidant-sensitive transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), and electrophile responsive element (EpRE), and production and release of the chemokine cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC). In F-344 rat hepatocytes, the activities of AP-1 and NF-kappaB were increased by as much as 3-fold by 6 h of 1,2-DCB treatment, when compared to control. Nuclear translocation of EpRE was also enhanced by 3-fold and occurred 2 h following 1,2-DCB treatment. These events were greater in F-344 than in SD rat hepatocytes incubated with 1,2-DCB. Moreover, F-344 rat hepatocytes produced and released CINC following incubation with 1,2-DCB, but SD rat hepatocytes did not. Lastly, conditioned media from 1,2-DCB-treated F-344 rat hepatocytes stimulated KC activity as determined by enhanced NF-kappaB-binding activity and increased nitric oxide production. Collectively, these data suggest that the mechanisms of 1,2-DCB-induced hepatotoxicity involve intercellular communication whereby compromised hepatocytes may signal KC activation via the production and release of oxidant-sensitive chemokines and cytokines.",

Although, hepatotoxic injury of o-DCB is greater in Fischer 344 (F344) when compared with Sprague Dawley (S-D) rats, this interstrain difference does not transcend into any difference in lethal effects of o-DCB. Interstrain difference in compensatory tissue repair has been suggested as the underlying mechanism for the lack of strain differences in lethality ... The objectives of the present study were (1) to investigate if the differences in compensatory tissue repair are reflected in differential protooncogene expression in S-D versus F344 rat livers and (2) to investigate if changes in protooncogene expression could explain the decrease and delay in tissue repair response beyond a threshold of 0.6 mL o-DCB/kg. Male S-D and F344 rats (8/9 weeks old) were administered either 0.6 or 1.2 mL o-DCB/kg and changes in expression of protooncogenes c-myc (immediate early) and Ha-ras (delayed early) were examined over a time course. Findings of this study indicate that the timing and extent of c-myc and Ha-ras expression varies in the two strains following administration of o-DCB. ...",

There is substantial evidence that para-dichlorobenzene induces these tumors through an alpha2u-globulin-associated response. Although para-dichlorobenzene does not bind to DNA in the male rat kidney, there is weak evidence that it binds to DNA in several tissues in treated mice. Both ortho- and para-dichlorobenzene have been reported to bind to proteins and DNA in the same mouse tissues. No attempt was made to isolate any DNA adducts. The data available on the genotoxicity of para-dichlorobenzene and ortho-dichlorobenzene also do not allow any distinction to be made between these two compounds, which differ significantly in their tumorigenicity: ortho-dichlorobenzene does not cause tumors, whereas para-dichlorobenzene causes liver tumors in mice and kidney tumors in male rats. Overall, the data on genotoxicity do not support a mechanism for renal-cell tumor induction in rats involving direct interaction of para-dichlorobenzene with DNA. Therefore, the overall data, including those on genotoxicity, indicate that para-dichlorobenzene causes renal tumors in male rats through an alpha2u-globulin associated response.",

Volatile compounds were analyzed in a glass column coated with 6% SP-2100 plus 4% OV-11 on Chromosorb W Semivolatile compounds, chlorinated compounds and pesticides were analyzed in a 70 m glass capillary column coated with 5% OV-101. Phenols were analyzed in a glass column packed with 1% SP-1240 DA on Supelcoport. The most efficient means of separation was to use the same glass column for volatile compounds, a DB-5 fused silica capillary column for semivolatile compounds, pesticides and phenols, and the same 1% SP-1240 DA glass column for separation of beta-BHC and pentachlorophenol.

SKIN: IMMEDIATELY flood affected skin with water while removing and isolating all contaminated clothing. Gently wash all affected skin areas thoroughly with soap and water. If symptoms such as redness or irritation develop, IMMEDIATELY call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital for treatment.  INHALATION: IMMEDIATELY leave the contaminated area; take deep breaths of fresh air. If symptoms (such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or burning in the mouth, throat, or chest) develop, call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital. Provide proper respiratory protection to rescuers entering an unknown atmosphere. Whenever possible, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) should be used; if not available, use a level of protection greater than or equal to that advised under Protective Clothing.  INGESTION: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. If the victim is conscious and not convulsing, give 1 or 2 glasses of water to dilute the chemical and IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center. Be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital if advised by a physician. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, ensure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body.

FIRE INVOLVING TANKS OR CAR/TRAILER LOADS: Fight fire from maximum distance or use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles. Do not get water inside containers. Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire. For massive fire, use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2016)",

Adequate mixing in the collection chamber was accomplished by externally agitating the ASTM cell at the required speed in a moving-tray water bath at 25 Â°C. The Viton glove did not show permeation even after 4 hr. The nitrile gloves showed breakthrough times of < 1 hr. The steady state molar flux rates for unsupported or supported nitrile gloves, or for the different challenge solvents were not statistically different. Breakthrough times were better indicators of permeation than steady state molar flux rates. A mixed permeation mechanism was proposed, depending on swelling of the glove material.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA, as amended in 1988, were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene is found on List C. Case No: 3057; Pesticide type: Antimicrobial; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered ... The case /is characterized/ as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI): 1,2-Dichlorobenzene; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered pesticide products ... \"cancelled.\"",

Administration of either compound dramatically reduced the severity of ortho-dichlorobenzene-induced liver injury, and both agents reduced the increase in plasma alanine aminotransferase activity by 80%; light microscopic examination confirmed that the reductions in enzyme activity reflected protection from hepatocellular injury. Interestingly, methyl palmitate did not protect against ortho-dichlorobenzene-induced hepatotoxicity in phenobarbital-pretreated rats, and the degree of inhibition of hepatotoxicity by polyethylene glycol-superoxide dismutase was not significantly different from that in normal rats. The lack of significant inhibition of phenobarbital-potentiated hepatotoxicity by both polyethylene glycol-superoxide dismutase and methyl palmitate suggests that reactive oxygen species released from a non-parenchymal source are not as crucial to the hepatotoxicity of ortho-dichlorobenzene in phenobarbital-pretreated as in the normal rats. The results suggest that reactive oxygen species released from Kupffer cells play a major role in the progression of orthodichlorobenzene hepatotoxicity.",

                          "String": "... 1,2-Dichlorobenzene has been shown to cause eye and respiratory irritation in humans at exposure levels above 100 ppm. Skin irritation has been observed following dermal application in humans and animals. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene is absorbed via the oral route. Absorption via the dermal or inhalation routes is poorly characterized. Inhalation is expected to be the major route for human exposure. The available toxicological data indicate that metabolic profiles and effects from 1,2-dichlorobenzene exposure are similar in rats, mice and humans. Animal studies with rats and mice have shown 1,2-dichlorobenzene to induce acute hepatotoxic effects. The LD50 for a single oral exposure to 1,2-dichlorobenzene for the rat ranges from 1516 to 2138 mg/kg bw. The LC100 for the rat is </= 977 ppm (5.9 mg/L) for a 10 hour exposure. During a 4 hour exposure, 1 of 20 rats died at 941 ppm (5.6 mg/L). In humans, the acute effects of 1,2-dichlorobenzene by ingestion or inhalation are reported to be headache, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, malaise and unconsciousness. Several oral studies of rats and mice ranging from 10 days to 2 years duration indicate that the adverse effects include increases in liver and kidney weights and hepatotoxicity. From these repeat dose studies, the NOAEL for non-neoplastic effects was 60 mg/kg bw, while the LOAEL was 120 mg/kg bw due to increased renal tubular regeneration in male mice. In several microbial organisms and mammalian systems, 1,2-dichlorobenzene tested negative in vitro. However, it did induce sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese Hamster ovary cells and increased mutation frequency in mouse lymphoma cells, both in the presence of metabolic activation. 1,2-dichlorobenzene was negative in several in vivo mammalian tests, except one of two micronuclei assays in mouse bone marrow was positive. In a two-year oral study in rats and mice, 1,2-dichlorobenzene was considered not to be carcinogenic (maximum dose of 120 mg/kg bw). In an inhalation 2-generation reproduction study in rats, no fertility effects were observed and reduced pup weight during lactation occurred at doses toxic to adults. The NOAEL and LOAEL (kidney and liver effects) for adult rats were 50 (0.3 mg/L) and 150 ppm (0.6 mg/L) respectively. In developmental studies in rats and rabbits, developmental effects were only seen in rats at maternally toxic doses (400 ppm, 2.4 mg/L). No human epidemiological studies have been conducted. ... 1,2-Dichlorobenzene has been tested on a wide range of aquatic organisms under acute exposure, although chronic data are scarce. Results for fish ranged from 96 hr LC50=1.58 mg/L for rainbow trout to 57 mg/L for fathead minnow. Both acute and chronic toxicity to aquatic invertebrates were obtained with two results showing high acute toxicity, namely EC50's of 0.78 mg/L and 0.66 mg/L to Daphnia and Ceriodaphnia respectively. Results from exposure to algae showed EC50 values in the 1-100 mg/L range for 1,2-dichlorobenzene. Toxicity to microorganisms can be considered slight. Although the major compartment expected to be exposed to 1,2-dichlorobenzene is the atmosphere, there are no ecotoxicity results available for organisms exposed through the gas phase. The chlorine substituents on the chemical suggest a potential for effects on stratospheric ozone. However, the chemical is unlikely to persist long enough to escape the troposphere, although it may persist long enough to undergo long range atmospheric transport. While there are a large number of acute data covering all trophic levels, chronic data are scarce. Therefore, an assessment factor of 100 has been chosen. The result used for determining the PNEC was the lowest chronic value obtained, i.e. 21 d NOEC = 0.63 mg/L for Daphnia magna. The PNECaquatic was therefore determined to be 6.3 ug/L.",

The method, applied to 57 chemicals, demonstrated that it could be used to detect the chemicals at low concentrations rapidly and with ease. The EC50 values showed a good relationship with 48 hr LC50 values for Himedaka (Oryzias latipes), and could be explained on the basis of the partition coefficient between water and n-octanol. EC50 for o-dichlorobenzene was 51 mg/L (350 umol/L).",

Embryos were reared in the presence of the agents for 48 hours, from the zygote to the pluteus larval stage. In addition, sperm inactivation was tested by adding agents to sperm suspensions, which were then used to inseminate untreated eggs. Benzene treatment at 10(-6) molar (M) showed a significant increase in embryo developmental defects and an elevated metaphase to anaphase (M) ratio indicating partial metaphase block, but no increase in total mitotic aberrations (TMA). With CB, developmental defects were only increased above controls at 10(-4)M. CB increased the M/A ratio, and the percentage of anaphase aberrations (AA) increased significantly with 10(-5) and 10(-4)M. A dose related response was found for o-DCB in developmental defects and for M/A ratio increases. For m-DCB, developmental defects and mitotic abnormalities were strongly increased. Sperm inactivation tests produced entirely different results. Only o-DCB and p-DCB caused spermiotoxicity. Developmental defects in the offspring of pretreated sperm were significant for all compounds, but primarily for benzene and CB. However, CB and o-DCB caused clear inhibition of mitosis. TMA increased with benzene, m-DCB, and p-DCB. For AA, the greatest effect was observed for CB, with lesser effects for m-DCB, o-DCB, and benzene. Both CB and o-DCB caused a sharp decrease in active mitotic figures and in anaphase figures (increased M/A), so that the lack of increase in TMA did not necessarily reflect the absence of any effect. The authors conclude that the results show some distinct toxicity patterns for the different agents, thus pointing out the need to reconsider criteria for ranking toxicities, in order to utilize multiple toxic endpoints.

                          "String": "Two-year toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of 1,2-dichlorobenzene were conducted by administering the test chemical in corn oil gavage five times per week for 103 weeks to groups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice at doses of 60 and 120 mg/kg. Groups of 50 rats and 50 mice of each sex received corn oil by gavage on the same schedule and served as vehicle controls. Survivals of female rats, male mice, and female mice were comparable to those of the corresponding vehicle controls in the 2-year study, but survival of high dose male rats was (P<0.001) shorter than that of the vehicle controls. In this group there were three accidental deaths and five deaths probably due to the gavage process; in addition aspiration of 1,2-dichlorobenzene in corn oil into the lungs may have been a contributing factor to the deaths of 12 high dose male rats. The 120 mg/kg dose level of 1,2-dichlorobenzene did not affect body weight in rats or mice of either sex or survival of mice or female rats. An increase in tubular regeneration in the kidney of high dose male mice was observed in the 2-year study (control, 8/48, 17%; low dose, 12/50, 24%; high dose, 17/49, 35%). No other compound-related nonneoplastic histological lesions were noted in the 2-year study.  The incidence of pheochromocytoma of the adrenal gland in low dose male rats was elevated (P<0.05, life table test) relative to controls (9/50, 16/50, 6/49). However, the incidence in the high dose group was lower than that of the controls and the dose-response trend was not statistically significant. Therefore, the increase in pheochromocytoma in the low dose male rats is not regarded as related to administration of 1,2-dichlorobenzene. A dose-related increase (P<0.05) in malignant histiocytic lymphoma was observed in male mice (control, 0/50, 0%; low dose, 1/50, 2%; high dose, 4/50, 8%) and in female mice (0/49, 0%; 0/50, 0%; 3/49, 6%); however, comparisons of the numbers of animals with all types of lymphomas is considered to be a more appropriate comparison. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene did not increase the incidence of all types of lymphomas (combined) in male mice (8/50, 16%; 2/50, 4%; 4/50, 8%) or female mice (11/49, 22%; 11/50, 22%; 13/49, 27%). Therefore, the increase in histiocytic lymphomas was discounted. Under the conditions of these two-year gavage studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity of 1,2-dichlorobenzene for male or female F344/N rats or B6C3F1 mice receiving 60 or 120 mg/kg/day.",

Its former use as a herbicide, insecticide, and soil fumigant, resulted in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, 1,2-dichlorobenzene will exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere, based on a vapor pressure of 1.4 mm Hg at 25 Â°C. Vapor-phase 1,2-dichlorobenzene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 38 days. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to undergo direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,2-dichlorobenzene is expected to have moderate mobility based upon Koc values of 280 and 320. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based on the Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-3 atm-cu m/mole at 20 Â°C. Volatilization of 1,2-dichlorobenzene from dry soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon the vapor pressure of this compound and a volatilization half-life of about 4 days measured in silt loams. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene is resistant to biodegradation in soils, with half-lives expected to be greater than 9 months. If released to water, 1,2-dichlorobenzene is expected to adsorb to sediment or particulate matter based on its measured Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important environmental fate process given this compounds Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 and 120 hours, respectively. BCF values in the range of 90 to 560 measured in fish, suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate to high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,2-dichlorobenzene is produced or used. Monitoring data suggest the general population may be exposed to 1,2-dichlorobenzene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water. (SRC)",

This value indicates that 1,2-dichlorobenzene will volatilize from water(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as approximately 4 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as approximately 120 hours(SRC). 1,2-Dichlorobenzene's Henry's Law constant(1) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based on a vapor pressure of 1.4 mm Hg at 25 Â°C(3). The volatilization half-life of 1,2-dichlorobenzene from Captina and McLaurin sandy loam soils was measured as about 4 days(4).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example \"H2SO4\" for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version \"H2O4S.\"",

The plasma concentration-time profile for chlorobenzene on cessation of exposure, as estimated by respiratory elimination of radioactivity, indicated a two compartment elimination. Increase in exposure by a factor of seven (100-700 ppm) increased the total uptake of radioactivity by a factor of about 13. This increase in body burden was associated with a decrease in total body clearance, as indicated by an approximate four fold increase in the half-life of the central compartment. The proportion of the dose excreted via the lungs (which may be presumed to be largely, if not entirely, unchanged chlorobenzene) increased nonlinearly and the proportion eliminated by hepatic metabolism decreased. Increase in the dose of chlorobenzene was associated with a decrease in the proportion cleared as the mercapturic acid derivative. Of interest, the half-life of chlorobenzene was shorter at the 700 ppm exposure level when the animals were subjected to repeated treatment daily for 5 days, as compared with that of the single 700 ppm exposure animals, raising the possibility of induction of metabolic clearance. In agreement with this possibility, the proportion cleared by metabolism in the multi-exposed animals was increased, and the proportion excreted unchanged via the lung was decreased, as compared with the 700 ppm-single exposure animals.",

MCB and 1,2-DCB were oxidized mainly by rat and human CYP2E1. It was found that 1,4-DCB was oxidized by rat and human CYP2E1 at a several-fold lower rate than 1,2-DCB, but a greater part to covalently binding products. In contrast to previous studies showing rat CYP3A1 as the main CYP form oxidising both DCBs, our experiments indicate only a certain role of rat and human CYP3A in MCB, 1,2-DCB and 1,4-DCB oxidation to covalently bound products. The relative roles of human liver CYP2E1 and 3A4 in the metabolism of 1,4-DCB seem to be individually different. Metabolic rates of MCB, 1,2-DCB and 1,4-DCB correlated with CYP2E1 immunochemical level in microsomes from 11 different human livers and with metabolic rates of CYP2E1 substrates. These rates in different human livers were up to 10-fold different and were generally several-fold higher than those in untreated rats or mice. Metabolic activation of MCB and 1,2-DCB to products binding covalently to microsomal proteins and to calf-thymus DNA, respectively, mostly corresponded to production of water-soluble metabolites. Significant species and sex differences in the oxidation of MCB, 1,2-DCB and 1,4-DCB were reflected in a markedly higher oxidation in male mice than male rats and higher oxidation in male than female mice. The formation of covalently bound products generally corresponded to production of soluble metabolites, but female rats formed significantly less covalently bound products of 1,4-DCB (and also of 1,2-DCB and MCB) than male rats and mice of both sexes ...",

The study group included 44 clinically healthy men from the facility ranging in age from 21 to 49 years. They were monitored during several shifts of the 24 day period required to perform the maintenance activities; 251 whole shift personal air sampling measurements were performed. All time weighted average exposure values of MCB were below the maximum concentration value in the work place that is currently recommended, 50 ppm. A urine sample was also collected which revealed that 4-chlorophenol and 4-chlorocatechol could be detected at exposure levels of MCB below the allowable limits. The production of 4-chlorocatechol was generally three times higher than that of 4-chlorophenol. A statistically significant correlation existed between the MCB time weighted average concentration and the concentration of each metabolite in the urine collected at the end of the workshift. /Results suggest/ caution that biological limit values should be considered as tentative since the metabolite concentration in urine were only characterized for MCB levels below 50 ppm.",

Twenty-four hour urine samples were collected over a period of 7 days. p-Chlorophenylmercapturic acid, chlorophenols and a guanine adduct was determined by chromatographic methods. The excretion pattern of p-chlorophenyl-mercapturic acid did not seem to be significantly affected by phenobarbital. To analyze for the chlorophenols and guanine adducts, diluted urine was subjected to cation exchange chromotography using UV-detection. Fractions were found containing chlorophenols and a compound showing chromatographic properties similar to those of the synthetic N7-phenylguanine. The results of the HPLC analyses suggested the presence of a guanine adduct excreted on days 1 and 2 and between days 4 and 6 post-administration. There were no compounds detected which were identical with p-, m- or o-isomers of N7-chlorophenylguanine. The excretion of p- and m-chlorophenols by phenobarbital-pretreated animals was twice as high as that in untreated rats. A 4-fold increase was detected for o-chlorophenol. It is assumed that it is mainly direct hydroxylation that can be induced by phenobarbital. Dehalogenated phenolic metabolites may be capable of covalent binding to DNA.",

Occupational studies have shown that acute and chronic exposure to chlorobenzene can cause irritation of the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and eyes. Using in vitro assays, /it was/ shown in a previous study that human bronchial epithelial cells release inflammatory mediators such as the cytokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in response to chlorobenzene. This response is mediated through the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Here, /researchers/ investigated the effects of monochlorobenzene on human lung cells, with emphasis on potential alterations of the redox equilibrium to clarify whether the chlorobenzene-induced inflammatory response in lung epithelial cells is caused via an oxidative stress-dependent mechanism. /It was/ found that expression of cellular markers for oxidative stress, such as heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), glutathione S-transferase pi1 (GSTP1), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) and dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), were elevated in the presence of monochlorobenzene. Likewise, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were increased in response to exposure. However, in the presence of the antioxidants N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine (MPG) or bucillamine, chlorobenzene-induced upregulation of marker proteins and release of the inflammatory mediator MCP-1 are suppressed. These results complement /the authors/ previous findings and point to an oxidative stress-mediated inflammatory response following chlorobenzene exposure.",

To characterize the underlying mechanisms ... the influence of chlorobenzene on the activation of two intracellular signalling pathways: the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways /were investigated/. Human lung epithelial cells (A549) were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in the presence or absence of specific inhibitors of NF-kappaB or the p38 MAP kinase and exposed to chlorobenzene using an air-liquid cell culture system. Exposure of lung epithelial cells to chlorobenzene resulted in an activation of NF-kappa B and p38 MAP kinase and a release of the chemokine MCP-1. In the presence of IKK-NBD, a specific NF-kappa B inhibitor, or the inhibitors of the p38 MAP kinase SB 203580 and SB 202190, the chlorobenzene-related MCP-1 release was suppressed, suggesting an involvement of both pathways in the chlorobenzene induced expression of MCP-1. /These/ data show that the release of MCP-1 following chlorobenzene exposure is dependent on the NF-kappa B and MAPK pathways.",

The extent of in vivo enzymatic activation of brominated compounds was higher than that of chlorinated chemicals. Aryl halides were bound mainly to liver DNA whereas interaction of alkyl halides with DNA of liver, kidney, and lung gave rise to similar binding extent. In vitro activation of all chemicals was mediated by microsomal p450-dependent mixed function oxidase system present in rat and mouse liver and, in smaller amount, in mouse lung. Activation of alkyl halides by liver cytosolic GSH-trasferases even occurred. The relative reactivity of chemicals in vivo, expressed as covalent binding index to rat liver DNA, was: 1,2-dibromoethane > bromobenzene > 1,2-dichloroethane > chlorobenzene > epichlorohydrin > benzene. On the whole, it agreed with in vitro activation of chemicals, with genotoxicity data from other short-term assays ... . Covalent binding index values of chlorobenzene and bromobenzene gave the first clear evidence of genotoxicity and of possible carcinogenicity of these two chemicals.",

A microsome-mediated interaction with DNA occurred in vitro. The interaction was enhanced by pretreatment in vivo with phenobarbitone but was suppressed by addition of 2-diethylaminoethyl-2,2-diphenylvalerate hydrochloric acid in vitro. These results indicate the involvement of cytochrome p450. Liver microsomes were efficient bioactivators, whereas cytosol was ineffective. The extent of in vitro interaction of chlorobenzene with synthetic polyribonucleotides was of the same order as that with DNA. Finally, ultraviolet irradiation (lambda= 254 nm or lambda max= 365 nm) activated this environmental contaminant to forms capable of interacting with DNA.",

ATR-FTIR spectra revealed that amide groups and PO(2)(-) of the phospholipid phospho-diester, both in the hydrophobic end exposed to the outer layer, were the easiest to be damaged. The relationship between IC(50) and chemicals structure parameters ..., indicated that the more chlorine atoms were substituted, the greater the toxicity was.

                      "String": "IDENTIFICATION: Chlorobenzene, in its pure form, is a colorless liquid that has an almond-like odor. It is volatile and flammable. Chlorobenzene dissolves moderately in water. Chloroenzene may occur in the environment from biodegradation of other chlorine compounds. Chlorobenzene was identified in volcano gases. It can be formed in nature during the formation of meteorites. USE: Chlorobenzene is used as a solvent for some pesticide formulations, as a degreaser, and to make other chemicals. EXPOSURE: Chlorobenzene is not a widespread environmental pollutant as in the past. Humans may be exposed to chlorobenzene by inhaling contaminated air, drinking water or eating food contaminated with chlorobenzene or by getting contaminated soil on your skin. These exposures are most likely to occur at workplaces making chlorobenzene or near chemical wastes sites. Occupational exposure is most likely by inhalation. Exposure could occur in people living or working near a hazardous waste site if emissions to water, air, or soil are not controlled very well. In air, chlorobenzene can be transported away from the source of contamination. Chlorobenzene in air is degraded by light with a half-life of 20 to 40 hours. Chlorobenzene absorbs to soil and is biodegraded rapidly. In water, it breaks down more slowly and can also evaporate. Chlorobenzene has been found in samples of surface waters and ground waters. RISK: Workers exposed to high levels of chlorobenzene in air have reported headaches, numbness, sleepiness, nausea and vomiting. Restlessness, tremors, unconsciousness and death have been observed at very high levels in animal studies. Animal studies have also shown that chlorobenzene can cause severe injury to the liver and kidneys. Chlorobenzene does not cause birth defects or affect the reproductive system. Studies in animals have shown that chlorobenzene can produce liver nodules, providing some but not clear evidence of cancer risk. (SRC)",

Flush victim's eyes with water or normal saline solution for 20 to 30 minutes while simultaneously calling a hospital or poison control center. Do not put any ointments, oils, or medication in the victim's eyes without specific instructions from a physician. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim after flushing eyes to a hospital even if no symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop.  SKIN: IMMEDIATELY flood affected skin with water while removing and isolating all contaminated clothing. Gently wash all affected skin areas thoroughly with soap and water. IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center even if no symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital for treatment after washing the affected areas.  INHALATION: IMMEDIATELY leave the contaminated area; take deep breaths of fresh air. IMMEDIATELY call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital even if no symptoms (such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or burning in the mouth, throat, or chest) develop. Provide proper respiratory protection to rescuers entering an unknown atmosphere. Whenever possible, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) should be used; if not available, use a level of protection greater than or equal to that advised under Protective Clothing.  INGESTION: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. If the victim is conscious and not convulsing, give 1 or 2 glasses of water to dilute the chemical and IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center. Be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital if advised by a physician. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, ensure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital.  OTHER: Since this chemical is a known or suspected carcinogen you should contact a physician for advice regarding the possible long term health effects and potential recommendation for medical monitoring. Recommendations from the physician will depend upon the specific compound, its chemical, physical and toxicity properties, the exposure level, length of exposure, and the route of exposure.

SMALL FIRE: Dry chemical, CO2, water spray or regular foam.  LARGE FIRE: Water spray, fog or regular foam. Do not use straight streams. Move containers from fire area if you can do it without risk.  FIRE INVOLVING TANKS OR CAR/TRAILER LOADS: Fight fire from maximum distance or use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles. Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire. For massive fire, use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2016)",

The product was collected in a trap cooled with liquid nitrogen and analyzed by gas/liquid chromatography. Model runs were also undertaken with chlorobenzene, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, and biphenyl at temperatures decreasing over a series of four runs from 875 degrees to 750. Conversions of PCBs were approximately 10, 28, 70, and greater than 99.9% after runs one through four, respectively. Dichlorobenzene and trichlorobenzene accounted for approximately 6% of the Aroclor feed. Chlorobenzene and biphenyl were also products, although the determination of chlorobenzene was obscured by its use as diluent. Methane and small amounts of ethylene, ethane, ethane, and traces of ethyne were also formed. In model runs with chlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene, and biphenyl the amount of biphenyl left was only 0.75%. Dechlorination was again approximately 95%, leaving only traces of 1,2,4-trichlorophenyl. Increasing temperature to 925 degrees increased dechlorination to 99.95%.",

After 20 hr of exposure cytotoxicity and the release of the pro-inflammatory molecules monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 was analyzed. Exposure of A549 cells to chlorobenzene, styrene or m-xylene increased the MCP-1 production within the indoor relevant concentration range (1-25,000 microg/cu m), higher concentrations increased the secretion of IL-8. Mixtures of aromatic compounds caused comparable effects to the single compounds on MCP-1 and IL-8 with a shift to lower concentration ranges. Neither the aliphatic compounds n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and methylcyclopentane nor the mixture of these VOC showed any effects on MCP-1 and IL-8 production. Cytotoxic effects were not observed. These results show that aromatic, but no aliphatic compounds stimulate the release of pro-inflammatory mediators from lung epithelial cells. When aromatic compounds were mixed the sensitivity of lung cells to these compounds was increased.",

Pretreatment with either toxicant alone, or in combination, elevated the metabolism of 1.12 g/kg chlorobenzene to conjugated and polar metabolites. The relative importance of these pathways was increased most by pretreatment with chlorobenzene plus lindane and least with chlorobenzene /alone/. The incidence and severity of chlorobenzene induced hepatocellular necrosis depended on how much the pretreatments increased excretion of these metabolites relative to that of p-chlorophenol, since the conjugates and polar metabolites represent an inactivation of the toxic chlorobenzene-3,4-epoxide, whereas, p-chlorophenol reflects its formation. Thus these changes in the metabolic pathways resulted in either (1) a marginally significant decrease in hepatoxicity (chlorobenzene pretreatment); (2) significance in both the incidence and severity of the lesions (lindane pretreatment) or (3) absence of centrilobular necrosis was present (chlorobenzene and lindane pretreatment). Apparently the effect of pretreatment with xenobiotics on chlorobenzene induced hepatotoxicity was dependent on how much the pretreatments altered the inactivation of chlorobenzene-3,4-epoxide relative to its formation.",

Male Wistar rats were injected ip with 2 mmol/kg bromobenzene, 4 mmol/kg toluene, or 4 mmol/kg chlorobenzene either alone or in combination. Rats were killed 12, 24, or 48 hr after injection and liver injury was assessed biochemically and histopathologically. Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase and liver glutathione were measured. In vitro experiments were performed on liver microsomes from male Wistar rats pretreated with phenobarbital. Toluene and chlorobenzene each inhibited bromobenzene hepatotoxicity as measured by suppression of glutamate pyruvate transaminase concentrations and by histopathology at 24 hr after treatment; chlorobenzene significantly decreased at 12 hr and recovered at 24 hours when bromobenzene was given alone. This recovery at 24 hr disappeared when chlorobenzene was coadministered. Kinetic analysis of rat liver microsomes of bromobenzene metabolism showed that both toluene and chlorobenzene at 6 mmol/L inhibited p-bromophenol formation but had no effects on o-bromophenol formation.",

It is used as an Intermediate in the manufacture of chloronitrobenzenes, oxide, DDT, and silicones; as a process solvent for methylene diisocyanate, adhesives, polishes, waxes, pharmaceutical products, paints, and natural rubber; as a degrading solvent; heat transfer medium; in textile processing; and tar and grease remover.  HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY:  Dermal exposure to chlorobenzene for 1 hour resulted in burning pain, hyperemia, whealing, and erythema formation at the application site.  Twelve hours postexposure, a minimal local vesiculation was seen.  Continuous contact for a week may result in moderate erythema and slight superficial necrosis.  Clinical symptoms included hyperpnea, ataxia, labored breathing, prostration, and death from respiratory paralysis.  Humans occupationally exposed to chlorobenzene intermittently for up to 2 years at levels above current federal limits displayed signs of neurotoxicity including numbness, cyanosis (from depression of respiratory center), hyperesthesia, and muscle spasms.  Early complaints included headache and irritation of the upper respiratory tract and mucosa of the eyes.  Clinical examination of workers exposed to chlorobenzene in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride showed that some workers reported nerve lesions, hepatitis, chronic gastritis with gastric juice hypoacidity, and bronchitis.  Severe anemia and medullary aplasia in a 70 year old woman was related to her employment in hat making, which required the use of glue containing 70% chlorobenzene.  A 2 year old boy swallowed 5 to 10 mL of Puran, a cleaning agent containing chlorobenzene and 2.5 hr after ingestion, lost consciousness and suffered vascular paralysis and heart failure.  He survived, and the odor of chlorobenzene was present in breath and urine for 5 to 6 days.  ANIMAL STUDIES:  Chlorobenzene is lethal following acute, intermediate, and chronic oral exposures in animals. Neurological effects of chlorobenzene have also been reported in animals following inhalation. Acute inhalation exposure produced muscle spasms followed by /CNS depression/ in rabbits exposed to 5 mg/L chlorobenzene (1,090 ppm) or greater for 2 hours.  Dermal contact resulted in moderate skin and eye irritant (tested in the guinea pig and rabbit, respectively).  Single ip injections of chlorobenzene in rats resulted in time- and dose-dependent hepatotoxicity, including liver necrosis, increased liver weights, and increased serum enzyme activities with dose-dependent recovery.  Systemic effects of single ip injections of chlorobenzene also included damage to the kidney, effects on bile and pancreatic flow, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and centrilobular necrosis.  Death occurred within 2 to 3 days after a single exposure to 4,000 mg/kg in corn oil by gavage in rats of both sexes, and in mice after a single exposure to 1,000 mg/kg.  Administration of chlorobenzene by gavage resulted in dose-dependent chemical induced injuries to the liver (centrilobular hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis), kidney (necrosis of the proximal tubular epithelium), bone marrow (myeloid depletion), spleen (lymphoid depletion or necrosis) and thymus at doses > or = 250 mg/kg.  Male and female mice exposed to chlorobenzene at 2500 mg/cu m daily, 7d/wk for 3 weeks showed loss of appetite, general emaciation, marked somnolence and weight loss; 5 animals died.  Autopsy revealed fatty degeneration in the liver, leading to acute yellow atrophy. The majority of mice showed a decrease in white blood cell number with relative decrease in neutrophils and relative increase in lympocytes.  Chronic exposure of mice to chlorobenzene at 100 mg/cu m daily for 3 months, showed increased agitation and motility and decreased white blood cell count with relative decrease in neutrophils and relative increase in lymphocytes.  In a two-generation study in rats, chlorobenzene in concentrations up to 450 ppm did not adversely affect reproductive performance or fertility. Chlorobenzene was not mutagenic for Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 or TA1538, with or without addition of rat liver or hamster liver homogenate.  Chlorobenzene did not induce DNA damage in Escherichia coli strains WP2 uvr A+ rec A+ or WP100 uvr A- rec A- or S. typhimurium strains TA1978 uvr B+ or TA1538 uvr B-.  Slight leukopenia and lymphocytosis occurred in mice exposed to chlorobenzene (0.1 mg/L) for 3 months. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Chlorobenzene was less hepatotoxic to trout than rats. This difference could not be totally accounted for by reduced absorption in trout. Chlorobenzenes caused significant increases in serum testosterone concentration in the crucian carps compared to the controls.",

Serum testosterone and 17 beta-estradiol concentrations were detected using radioimmunology assay (RIA), and the activities of two hepatic microsome enzymes, glutathione s-transferase (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT), were measured using the modified methods as described by Habig and Owens. Results showed that the four chlorobenzenes caused significant increases in serum testosterone concentration in the crucian carps (P < 0.05) compared to the controls, but they caused no significant effect on 17 beta-estradiol level. All test chemicals caused a change in hepatic GST activity in crucian carps, with significant increases in enzyme activity (P < 0.05). Chlorobenzene, 1,3-dichlorobenzene and p-chloro-methylbenzene resulted in a marked inhibition to UDPGT activity in crucian carp (P < 0.05) except 1,4-dichlorobenzene. The changes in hepatic microsome enzyme activities may have resulted in the alterations of serum sex steroids levels in the crucian carps.",

The organisms were exposed to chlorobenzene solutions for 48 hr to obtain effective concentration (EC50) values (in terms of percent DNA reduction). The toxicity (EC50) increased with increasing degree of chlorination, as follows: monochlorobenzene (235.74 mg/L), dichlorobenzenes (23.33-51.88 mg/L), trichlorobenzenes 0.59-6.42 mg/L), tetrachlorobenzenes (0.27-1.39 mg/L), pentachlorobenzene (0.008 mg/L) and hexachlorobenzene (0.002 mg/L). Quantitative structure-activity relationships were developed showing high correlations, as follows: water solubility (r2 = 0.96); molecular volume (r2 = 0.92); zero-order connectivity index (r2 = 0.92); second-order connectivity index (r2 = 0.02); molecular surface area (r2 = 0.92); octanol/water partition coefficients (r2 - 0.86); bioconcentration factor (r2 = 0.86); and inorganic/organic character (r2 = 0.83). A poor correlation, however, was obtained with the molecular negentropy index (r2 = 0.25). The toxic effect (EC50) was explained in terms of a partitioning process as a function of the aqueous solubility of the chlorobenzenes and was found to occur at similar degrees of exposure saturation.",

Data from analytical monitoring programs in large rivers and estuaries in the North Sea area were collected and evaluated for effects and environmental concentrations. Risk is indicated by the ratio of predicted environmental concentration (PEC) to predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) for the marine aquatic environment. In total, 27 data for fish, 24 data for invertebrates and 13 data for algae were evaluated. Acute and chronic toxicity studies were taken into account and appropriate assessment factors used to define a final PNEC value of 32 microg/L. Recent monitoring data indicate that monochlorobenzene levels in surface waters are below determination limits of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 ug/L used in monitoring programs. Assuming that half of the lowest determination (0.1 ug/L) is typical, a PEC of 0.05 ug/L was derived. A worst case of 0.5 ug/L is assumed. PEC/PNEC ratios give safety factors of 60 to over 500, taking no account of dilution in the sea. Monochlorobenzene is not a toxic, persistent and liable to bioaccumulate substance sensu the Oslo and Paris Conventions for the Prevention of Marine Pollution (OSPAR-DYNAMEC) criteria. Environmental fate and effects data indicate that current use of monochlorobenzene poses no unacceptable risk to the aquatic environment.",

Chlorobenzene has been identified as one of various halocarbons emitted in volcanic gases. It has been detected in flue gas emissions from municipal waste incinerators. Chlorobenzene can be formed in the environment through microbial degradation of higher chlorinated benzenes. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 12 mm Hg at 25 Â°C indicates chlorobenzene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase chlorobenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 21 hrs. Chlorobenzene absorbs light at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. Vapor-phase deposition of chlorobenzene from ambient air to snow and ice may occur through sorption. If released to soil, chlorobenzene is expected to have very high to moderate mobility based upon a Koc range of 4.8 to 313. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.11X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Chlorobenzene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data are conflicting. Chlorobenzene biodegrades slowly in soil and aquifer material. Biological screening tests have observed slow biodegradation, with degradation occurring more rapidly with acclimated microorganisms. If released into water, chlorobenzene may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.4 hours and 4.3 days, respectively. Reported BCF values of 3.9 to 450 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. In water, some biodegradation occurs, proceeding more rapidly in fresh water than in estuarine and marine waters. Occupational exposure to chlorobenzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where chlorobenzene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to chlorobenzene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal and inhalation contact with consumer products containing this compound.

Chlorobenzene is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 12 mm Hg at 25 Â°C(5). Chlorobenzene biodegrades slowly in soil and aquifer material(6). Biodegradation data are conflicting. A 0% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test classifies chlorobenzene as not readily biodegradable(7). Other biological screening tests have observed slow biodegradation(8). Biodegradation occurs more rapidly with acclimated microorganisms(6,8).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.11X10-3 atm-cu m/mole(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.4 hours and 4.3 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), a BCF range of 3.9 to 450(7,8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to high(SRC). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process(SRC) since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). Chlorobenzene biodegrades slowly(9). However, biodegradatoin data are conflicting. In water, some biodegradation occurs, proceeding more rapidly in fresh water than in estuarine and marine waters(9). A 0% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test classifies chlorobenzene as not readily biodegradable(7). Other biological screening tests have observed slow biodegradation(10). Biodegradation occurs more rapidly with acclimated microorganisms(9,10).",

Vapor-phase chlorobenzene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 21 days(SRC),  calculated from its rate constant of 7.70X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 Â°C(3).

The biodegradation half-life of chlorobenzene was reported to be 150 days in river water and 75 days in sediment(2). Chlorobenzene was generally not mineralized after 8 months incubation in soil(3). A half-life of 7 days was measured in soil-groundwater slurries using natural microbial consortia isolated from contaminated soils and groundwater(4). No degradation of chlorobenzene occurred over a period of 8 months in a laboratory study using subsurface soil samples from an uncontaminated environment(4). Chlorobenzene, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in four weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(5). 99.0% removal of chlorobenzene was observed in a pilot-scale activated sludge system, an estimated 82.8% was attributed to biodegradation, 1.5% was adsorbed, and 14.7% was stripped(6). Chlorobenzene achieved 15% degradation after a 28-day incubation period using an activated sludge inoculum and a modified MITI test protocol(7). Using OECD 301B (Modified Sturm Test - CO2 Evolution) with an adapted activated sludge inoculum, only 10% theoretical CO2 evolved after 63 days(7). Greater than 90% degradation of chlorobenzene occurred after 15 days in a Sapromat respirometry test using an industrial non-adapted activated sludge inoculum(7). Using a closed-bottle 28-day BOD test protocol, chlorobenzene achieved a 73% degradation classifying the compound as readily biodegradable(8).",

In pond water amended with nutrients and in pond water amended with nutrients and sewage inoculum, chlorobenzene was reduced to concentrations below the detection limit after 12 days incubation; in pond water amended with nutrients and a sewage inoculum, the major product of chlorobenzene biotransformation was carbon dioxide(1). No loss of chlorobenzene was observed in sterile controls(1). The addition of sediment (0.61 g/L) did not significantly affect the biotransformation of chlorobenzene(1). Bacterial isolates obtained from groundwater and soils contaminated with chlorobenzene could mineralize approx 54% of the chlorobenzene within 7 days when supplemented with ammonium and phosphate; 85 and 99% of chlorobenzene added to groundwater microcosms was utilized by 28 days(2). In soil/groundwater microcosms at a former solvent storage site, a 49% reduction in the chlorobenzene concentration was observed over a 1-month period; 42% and 59% reduction in the chlorobenzene concentration was observed in microcosms amended with nutrients(3). A turnover time of 60,731 hours was measured in Lula, OK aquifer solid slurries under aerobic conditions(4). Biodegradation half-lives in not heavily polluted aquifer material were >540 days, 240 to 281 days, 88 years, and >490 days in Oklahoma sandy clay, OK gravel, OK sand, and OK sand, respectively(5). Complete mineralization of chlorobenzene, up to its maximum solubility level, occurred after 3 weeks of continuous operation in a stirred tank bioreactor(6). Results of flow-through column studies using sediment samples collected from sites contaminated by chlorobenzene revealed that chlorobenzene was readily biodegraded when migrating across the sediment/water interface(7).",

An 81.3% loss (half-life of 138 days) of chlorobenzene was observed in sediment samples obtained from the Tsurumi River, Japan over 1 year under anaerobic conditions; in autoclaved sediment, approx 50% loss of chlorobenzene was observed over the  1-year incubation period(2). 82% of the original chlorobenzene concentration was removed during a 47-day study using denitrifying bacteria, capable of degrading a mixture of aromatic compounds, isolated from sequential batch cultures; 60% was converted to carbon dioxide(3). In laboratory microcosm studies, anaerobic biodegradation of radio-labeled monochlorobenzene was demonstrated by mineralization to radio-labeled CO2(4).",

Chlorobenzene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). Chlorobenzene absorbs light in the environmental spectrum between 290-310 nm and may be susceptible to direct photolysis in the trophosphere and in surface water(3). Monochlorobiphenyl has been identified as a photoproduct(4). A photolysis half-life of 21 sunlight days was measured in water(5). Photolysis half-lives of 17.5 hours and 3.80 hours were measured in distilled water and Isar River water, Germany, respectively; chlorophenol and phenol were identified as photoproducts in river water(6).",

A log BCF of 2.65 has been reported for chlorobenzene in fathead minnows(2) that corresponds to a BCF of 450(SRC). A BCF of 41 was measured in bluegill fish (Lepomis macrochirus) over a 14-day exposure period(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these BCF values suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms ranges from low to high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). Dissolved organic matter that is present in interstitial water may greatly reduce the amount of a chemical that is available for accumulation(5). In one set of experiments, midge larvae were found to accumulate higher tissue-to-sediment ratios of chlorobenzene from a low-organic content sediment than from a high-organic content sediment(5). BCFs of 0.25 (from sediment), 11 (from interstitial water), and 10 (overlying water) were measured for midge larvae exposed to chlorobenzene under equilibrium exposure conditions(5). BCFs of 0.15 (from sediment), 310 (from interstitial water), and 5 (from overlying water) were measured for midge larvae exposed to chlorobenzene sorbed to high-organic content sediment under nonequilibrium exposure conditions(5). BCFs of 0.72 (from sediment), 18 (from interstitial water), and 2,187 (from overlying water) were measured for midge larvae exposed to chlorobenzene sorbed to low-organic content sediment under nonequilibrium exposure conditions(5).",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that chlorobenzene is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 3.4 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 4.3 days(SRC). Chlorobenzene's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Chlorobenzene is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 12 mm Hg(3). Chlorobenzene applied to soil at a uniform concentration of 1 kg/ha at depths of 1 cm and 10 cm underwent 86.5 and 23.4% loss, respectively, in a day; volatilization half-lives of 0.3 and 12.6 days, respectively, were estimated from this data(4). Volatilization half-lives of 13, 21, and 4.6 days were estimated for chlorobenzene using data obtained from an experimental marine mesocosm under simulated winter, spring, and summer conditions, respectively(5). Chlorobenzene was removed within 8 days in sterile pond water incubated in bottles open to the atmosphere(6). Volatilization rates of chlorobenzene from the wastewater-dependent constructed Tres Rios Demonstration Wetlands near Phoenix, AZ ranged from 5.11X10-6 to 8.48X10-6 sec-1, corresponding to a half-life of approximately 9 hours(7). In a closed aerated laboratory system simulating arable soil exposed to 14-C radio-labeled chlorobenzene, analysis of trapped 14-CO2 and 14-C chlorobenzene gas indicated that volatilization was the main loss mechanism with mineralization having minor importance(8).",

In a survey of 19 small-medium sized municipal landfills in Wisconsin, chlorobenzene was detected in 5 of 113 groundwater samples (max concentration, 16 ug/L) and in 2 of 79 monitoring well samples(2). Well water samples collected over a four-year period from a well on a pesticide plant near Ashdod, Israel were  found to contain chlorobenzene concentrations of 2, 9, 0, and 21 ug/L on 7/1988, 6/1989, 1/1990, and 4/1991, respectively(3). In a study conducted between 1986 and 1989 of the alluvial aquifer of the Sava River, Northern Croatia, chlorobenzene was detected, but not quantified, at three field sites near Zagreb, Yugoslavia(4). Chlorobenzene was identified as one of the 20 most abundant organic constituents in groundwater at 479 U.S. waste disposal sites; chlorobenzene was detected at 86 sites (18%)(5). A study of groundwater contamination at 6 Superfund sites across the U.S. detected chlorobenzene in the Biscayne, FL Aquifer study area, concentration of 30 ug/L, and in the Eau Claire Municipal well field, WI, concentration not specified(6). Chlorobenzene was identified in groundwater samples at a former incinerator site near Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in concentrations ranging from 2 to 300 ug/L(7). In the aquifer of the Bitterfeld/Wolfen region in Germany, a former production site for lindane, chlorobenzene concentrations are as high as 30 mg/L(8).",

Water samples collected from various locations in and around the Ho-Chin River of Taiwan were found to contain chlorobenzene ranging in concentrations from 1.6 to 1.65 ug/L(2). Chlorobenzene was identified in an analysis of subsurface riverine and marine waters conducted at the mouths of the Besos and Llobregat Rivers near Barcelona, Spain(3). The concentration of chlorobenzene in the Besos and Llobregat Rivers near Barcelona, Spain was determined to be 260 and 210 ng/L, respectively; chlorobenzene was not identified in adjacent marine coastal waters(4). Chlorobenzene was identified in an aqueous sample collected near Quantico, VA as having a concentration of <2 ug/L(5). Chlorobenzene was identified in surface water/groundwater samples impacted by municipal landfill leachate in Orange County, Alachua County (southwest), and Alachua County (southeast), FL as having concentrations ranging from <0.20 to 302 ug/L(6). The analysis of 315 water samples collected between February and June 1987 from the municipal water supply of Santiago De Compostela, Spain showed no chlorobenzene present(7). The level of chlorobenzene detected in urban rivers and their estuaries in Osaka, Japan was approximately 0.21 ug/L(8). Annual flux of chlorobenzene concentrations in four industrialized rivers (Aire, Calder, Don and Trent) of the Southern Humber Cachment UK were 2.52, 0.94, 0.12 and 3.84 kg/yr, respectively; rivers monitored weekly from February 1995 to February 1997(9).",

Chlorobenzene was detected in composite human adipose tissue samples of 763 individual specimens, concentration unknown, collected in fiscal year 1982 for the NHATS (National Human Adipose Tissue Survey) Broad Scan Analysis Program(3). The median concentration in serum of: current transformer repair workers, 0.32 ppb (thirty-five subjects), former transformer repair workers, 0.30 ppb (seventeen subjects), and a control group, 0.26 ppb (fifty-six subjects)(4). In a study conducted by the USEPA in 1984, the personal air of 188 California residents was sampled; chlorobenzene was detected in 0-13% of the population(5). Personal indoor air sampling (24-hour) for residents of two Japanese cities in 1996 and 1997 found chlorobenzene levels of 0.05-0.06 mg/cu m(6).",

Since 1984, the purchase and use of pentachlorophenol has been restricted to certified applicators. It is no longer available to the general public. It is still used industrially as a wood preservative for utility poles, railroad ties, and wharf pilings.",

Acute inhalation exposures in humans have resulted in neurological, blood, and liver effects, and eye irritation. Chronic (long-term) exposure to pentachlorophenol by inhalation in humans has resulted in effects on the respiratory tract, blood, kidney, liver, immune system, eyes, nose, and skin. Human studies are inconclusive regarding pentachlorophenol exposure and reproductive effects. Human studies suggest an association between exposure to pentachlorophenol and cancer.

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example \"H2SO4\" for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version \"H2O4S.\"",

During the period 2002-2004, cord blood specimens were collected in parallel with maternal specimens from women delivering in the two eastern Slovak districts of Michalovce and Svidnik/Stropkov. A total of 92 pairs of mother-cord specimens at delivery were selected for this study. 4-OH-CB107, 3-OH-CB153, 4-OH-CB146, 3'-OH-CB138, 4-OH-CB187, and 4'-OH-CB172 were quantified. The median concentrations of Sigma(17)PCBs, Sigma(6)OH-PCBs, and PCP in cord serum were 0.92, 0.33, and 0.69 ng/g wet wt, respectively, and highly correlated with the corresponding maternal serum levels (correlations were R(2) = 0.61, 0.78, and 0.82, respectively). The median cord to mother ratios of the Sigma(17)PCBs, Sigma(6)OH-PCBs, and PCP were 0.18, 0.75, and 1.10, respectively. The median ratio of the Sigma(6)OH-PCBs to the Sigma(17) PCBs in the cord serum was 0.38 from wet wt based concn, which was about four times higher than the ratio of these compounds in maternal serum (0.09). PCP was more abundant than any PCB or OH-PCB congener measured in cord serum. The higher cord to maternal ratios of OH-PCB metabolites as compared with the parent cmpd suggests either a higher placental transfer rate or greater metabolism in the fetus as compared with the maternal compartment. These findings are consistent with their preferential binding to TTR that can cross the placenta. The cord to maternal ratio varies by congener (e.g., 4-OH-CB107 = 0.58, 4-OH-CB146 = 0.74, 3'-OH-CB138 = 1.01).",

Pentachlorophenol when incubated with microsomes, was converted into tetrachloro-1,2-hydroquinone and tetrachloro-1,4-hydroquinone. Isosafrole increased the rate of conversion 7 times as compared to control microsomes, while hexachlorobenzene, pentachlorophenol and 3-methylcholanthrene increased the rate of conversion 2 to 3 times. The fact that pentachlorophenol and hexachlorobenzene accounted for the production of tetrachloro-1,4-hydroquinone and tetrachloro-1,2-hydroquinone in a ratio of about 2, as compared to a ratio of about 1.3 for 3-methylcholanthrene and isosafrole, and the fact that this ratio decreased with increasing concentrations of pentachlorophenol in microsomes from hexachlorobenzene treated rats, were indicative of the involvement of the various cytochrome p450 isoenzymes. The covalent binding of pentachlorophenol to protein was inhibited by ascorbic acid, with a subsequent increase in the production of tetrachlorohydroquinones. The rate of covalent protein binding was constant, regardless of variation in the rate of conversion observed in the mirosomes of rats treated with various inducers. DNA binding was conversion dependent and was lower than protein binding. The addition of DNA did not affect the formation of soluble metabolites.",

Tetrachlorophenols, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone, 2,3,4-trichlorophenol, 2,3,5-trichloro-1,4-hydroquinone, and their glucuronide conjugates were found in animals and man. Also identified were pentachlorophenylacetate, pentachloroanisole, and pentachlorophenylsulfate. The biotransformation of pentachlorophenol in man and animals takes place by conjugation, hydrolytic dechlorination, and reductive dechlorination. Further species dependent reactions are oxidation and methylation. The reaction with glutathione results in the formation of conjugates and cleavage of glycine and glutamate gives cysteine conjugates. Acetylation of the amino group of the cysteinyl moiety in mammals gives mercapturic acids. The metabolic pathways leading to dechlorinated derivatives may be mediated by the reaction with glutathione as the presence of the N-acetyl-S-(pentachlorophenyl)cysteine would indicate. The results of metabolic in vivo studies on hexachlorobenzene, pentachloronitrobenzene, pentachlorobenzene, and pentachlorophenol indicate that one pathway stems from hexachlorobenzene and pentachloronitrobenzene via sulfur containing conjugates to thiophenolic derivatives and to chlorinated benzenes, primarily to pentachlorobenzene. Another pathway transforms pentachlorophenol to less chlorinated phenols. The authors state that pentachlorophenol is a metabolite of various environmental chemicals and is itself metabolized. Therefore there is no direct relationship between the level of pentachlorophenol in body fluids and the degree of exposure.",

PCP binds to mitochondrial protein and inhibits mitochondrial ATP-ase activity. Thus, both the formation of ATP and the release of energy to the cell from the breakdown of ATP to ADP are prevented. Electron transport is not inhibited by PCP, although reactions dependent on available high-energy bonds, such as oxidative and glycolytic phosphorylation, are affected. Binding to enzymic protein has been reported and may lead to the inhibition of other cellular enzymes. There is an increase in cellular oxygen demand during the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. This causes the initial rise in respiration rate reported in individuals poisoned by PCP. PCP is toxic to the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. The toxicity of PCP is increased by impurities in some formulations. In some instances, it is very difficult to know whether the impurities have affected the poisoning. Dermatitis and chloracne are caused by contaminants such as PCDDs and PCDFs.",

Results from Western blot also shown /significant/ increases in the expression of cyclins D1, E and A and cdk4. The mitogenic response was also related to a /significant/ increase in the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb). PCP would cause apoptosis up-regulating the transcriptional activity of p53 gene and also increasing their activation by phosphorylation, concomitant with a decrease in the sirtuin 1 content. In conclusion, acute exposure of CGNs to PCP induces the classical p53 apoptotic pathway, promotes the up-regulation of several genes related to oxidative stress and the over-expression of molecules involved in the cell cycle control.",

Thus the poisons uncouple phosphorylation from oxidation. Free energy from the electron transport chain then converts to more body heat. As body temp rises, heat-dissipating mechanisms are overcome and metabolism is speeded. More adenosine diphosphate and other substrates accumulate, and these substrates stimulate the electron transport chain further. The electron transport chain responds by using up more and more available oxygen (increasing oxygen demand) in an effort to produce adenosine triphosphate but much of the free energy generated is liberated as still more body heat. Oxygen demand quickly overcomes oxygen supply, and energy reserves become depleted. /Chlorophenols/",

A number of (very) toxic byproducts are produced in small quantities during the synthesis (e.g., polychlorinated dibenzofurans, chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins). This has led to severe restriction in the use of this compound in Western countries.",

However, pentachlorophenol is only one of many sources of CDDs, CDFs, and HCB in the environment making it difficult to quantify the portion of the aggregate environmental risk from CDDs, CDFs, and HCB that is attributable to pentachlorophenol ... CDDs and CDFs have been identified as micro-contaminants in technical grade pentachlorophenol. CDDs and CDFs have been found throughout the world at low concentrations in air, soil, water, sediment, fish and shellfish, and other food products such as meat and dairy products. CDDs and CDFs are members of a family of polychlorinated isomers of \"dioxin-like\" compounds. Physical and chemical properties and toxicity vary with the degree of chlorination. The most toxic congener of the family is 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD). The dioxin/furan contaminants of pentachlorophenol present a unique case for purposes of risk characterization. Up to 17 CDD/CDF congeners are produced as contaminants in the manufacture of technical grade pentachlorophenol. All of these contaminants have chlorine substitution in at least the 2,3,7, and 8 positions, thus imparting these contaminants with \"dioxin like\" activity. Thus, all must be considered in the risk assessment for the contaminants of pentachlorophenol. HCB has also been identified as a micro-contaminant in technical grade pentachlorophenol, and is not a naturally occurring compound. It is present in the environment through emissions into the atmosphere due to the manufacture of PCP and numerous emission processes, industrial discharge of HCB containing wastes into waterways as well as due to the manufacturing processes of some pesticides. Since HCB is a micro-contaminant in technical grade pentachlorophenol, it must also be considered in the risk assessment for the contaminants of pentachlorophenol.",

One is the provisional protection of freshly cut wood from blue rot by soaking it in an aqueous solution containing 3-5% sodium pentachlorophenate. The protection lasts 6-11 months. Sodium pentachlorophenate [131-52-2] is formed by the reaction of pentachlorophenol with NaOH. The second use is the long-term protection of wood from fungi by soaking it or permeating it in an autoclave with solvents containing pentachlorophenol at 3-5% concentration. Protection lasts 25-40 years. This is the only use of pentachlorophenol in the United States. Last is the treatment of heavy-duty textiles used in manufacturing cables, rigging, and tarpaulins. The treatment is based on the lauric ester of pentachlorophenol. This market is not large and no longer exists in the United States.",

Today, the use of PCP is restricted or forbidden in many countries not only because of its persistency in the environment but also because of the possible formation of highly toxic polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, particularly octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD), on heating PCP or incinerating PCP-treated wood, and the possible presence of dioxins as impurities in technical-grade PCP. Nevertheless, in the USA PCP is still a popular preservative for utility poles where it is applied dissolved in diesel oil by pressure treatment at retention levels of 5-8 kg/cu m of wood for pine species.",

Urine and water samples were digested at 100 Â°C for 1 hr in a sealed vial and later were extracted with toluene. Serum samples were acidified and then digested and extracted as above. Fish tissue washomogenized, acidified to pH 2, and rehomogenized; the emulsion was extracted with methylene chloride, extracted with alkali, and finally with toluene and digested as above. All samples were treated with an internal standard, diluted as appropriate, and subjected to gas chromatography at 300 Â°C using fused silica capillary columns. Samples were injected at 1 microliter volume and detection of compounds was facilitated by electron capture at 350 Â°C. A calibration standard of pure pentachlorophenol was run; the time of chromatographic run was 1 hr. Good resolution was achieved. Concentrations as low as 0.5 ppb wre detected by this method. The precision of the method was 1.2% for pentachlorophenol. The upper limit of detection was 200 ppb. Samples of water, urine, serum, and fish tissue contained a detectable concentration. Corrections were made to compensate for instrument drift. This method offers high sensitivity and precision for examining pentachlorophenol.",

Acute inhalation exposures in humans have resulted in neurological, blood, and liver effects, and eye irritation. Chronic (long-term) exposure to pentachlorophenol by inhalation in humans has resulted in effects on the respiratory tract, blood, kidney, liver, immune system, eyes, nose, and skin. Human studies are inconclusive regarding pentachlorophenol exposure and reproductive effects. Human studies suggest an association between exposure to pentachlorophenol and cancer.

Flush victim's eyes with water or normal saline solution for 20 to 30 minutes while simultaneously calling a hospital or poison control center. Do not put any ointments, oils, or medication in the victim's eyes without specific instructions from a physician. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim after flushing eyes to a hospital even if no symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop.  SKIN: IMMEDIATELY flood affected skin with water while removing and isolating all contaminated clothing. Gently wash all affected skin areas thoroughly with soap and water. IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center even if no symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital for treatment after washing the affected areas.  INHALATION: IMMEDIATELY leave the contaminated area; take deep breaths of fresh air. IMMEDIATELY call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital even if no symptoms (such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or burning in the mouth, throat, or chest) develop. Provide proper respiratory protection to rescuers entering an unknown atmosphere. Whenever possible, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) should be used; if not available, use a level of protection greater than or equal to that advised under Protective Clothing.  INGESTION: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. Phenols are very toxic poisons AND corrosive and irritating, so that inducing vomiting may make medical problems worse. IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center and locate activated charcoal, egg whites, or milk in case the medical advisor recommends administering one of them. If advice from a physician is not readily available and the victim is conscious and not convulsing, give the victim a glass of activated charcoal slurry in water or, if this is not available, a glass of milk, or beaten egg whites and IMMEDIATELY transport victim to a hospital. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, assure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital.  OTHER: Since this chemical is a known or suspected carcinogen you should contact a physician for advice regarding the possible long term health effects and potential recommendation for medical monitoring. Recommendations from the physician will depend upon the specific compound, its chemical, physical and toxicity properties, the exposure level, length of exposure, and the route of exposure.

It was found that adsorption on kaolinite was negligible, whereas bentone SD-3 presented an adsorption efficiency from 10 to 100 fold less than equivalent quantities of powdered activated carbon. The effect of the pH on the removal of pentachlorophenol by activated carbon was studied. The removal efficiency of pentachlorophenol by activated carbon is better in acidic media. A clear dependence of adsorption on the pH appeared to be the result of a marked variation on the pesticide solubility as a function of the pH. Adsorption of pentachlorophenol/phenate (5 mg/l) diminishes markedly at pH values above the pKa of this weak acid (equal to 5.9 : 0.1) when the pentachlorophenol exists almost entirely in ionic form in aqueous solution, and is enhanced at low pH when the percentage of molecular species (whose concentration can be determined from pKa value) becomes significant. These remarks and the adsorptive capacities (163 mg.g-1 = 0.6 mmol/g at pH = 5.2 and 79 mg/g = 0,3 mmol/g at pH = 12.7), suggest a negative interaction between pentachlorophenol and activated carbon which seems to be confirmed by the results with bentone SD-43 (tables 1 to 4), and the values of the electrokinetic potential of these materials. This study emphasizes the effect of organic coadsorbates (eg, dissolved humic substances and the pesticide lindane) on the adsorption capacity of activated carbon for pentachlorophenol. Two different natural organic matters were studied as coadsorbates: purified humic acids from a commercial source (at 10 mg/l) and fulvic acids extracted from a top soil horizon (at 20 mg/l). Pentachlorophenol absorption was not affected by humic acids, whereas an increase of adsorption seemed to be observed in the presence of fulvic acids. Pentachlorophenol does not affect the adsorption of the humic acids, but improves slightly the removal of fulvic acids. This suggests an association between the two kinds of organic compounds, the resulting complex, fulvic acids/pentachlorophenol, being more adsorbed than the compounds themselves. The coadsorbate lindane (0.65 mg/l) which is easily adsorbed by activated carbon seemed also to improve slightly the removal efficiency of pentachlorophenol by activated carbon.",

Moreover, groundwater pumped from a well depth of 21 m at a location adjacent to the site was heavily contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other organics. A study was conducted to determine the efficacy of ultrafiltration for removal of organics from groundwater at this USEPA, Super Fund site. Ultrafiltration reduced the concentration of total identified organics from 210.0 mg/l in groundwater to 1.5 mg/l in the post filtration permeate. Tests for toxicity/teratogenicity in embryonic inland silversides, Menidia beryllina; and Microtox 15 min EC50's were conducted with: (1) streamwater, (2) untreated groundwater, (3) feedwater used in the ultrafiltration system and (4) permeate water that passed through the ultrafiltration system. Concentration of 100% streamwater caused significant (alpha : 0.05) teratogenic responses in fish embryos and larvae; the Microtox EC50 was 3.7% streamwater. Groundwater and feedwater caused significant embryo toxic or teratogenic responses at concentrations of 100, 10, and 1%; the Microtox EC50's were 0.85 and 0.48%, respectively. In contrast, only 100% permeate water caused significant increases in terata, compared to the control response; at 10 and 1% concentration > 90% of hatched larvae appeared normal. The Microtox EC50 was 30% permeate water.",

The space between primary & secondary container should be filled with absorbent material, which would withstand chem attack from the carcinogen & is sufficient to absorb the entire contents of the primary container in the event of breakage or leakage. Each secondary container should then be enclosed in a strong outer box. The space between the secondary container & the outer box should be filled with an appropriate quantity of shock-absorbent material. Sender should use fastest & most secure form of transport & notify recipient of its departure.

Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List C, and with List C containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List D. Pentachlorophenol is found on List B.

In addition, a high incidence of two uncommon tumors (adrenal medulla pheochromocytomas and hemangiomas/hemangiosarcomas) was observed with both preparations.

Both chemicals revealed lethal and sub-lethal effects, such as no blood flow, cardiac edema, delayed hatching, and tail malformations. According to their median effective concentrations (EC(50) values) in the single exposure, the toxic level of PCP was about two orders of magnitude higher than that of BPA. Result of the joint action modes varied depending on different endpoints. Synergistic action was observed based on the endpoint of 24 hr mortality and antagonistic effect displayed based on the endpoint of 72 hr cardiac edema. It was also found that the toxicity of PCP would be enhanced with the addition of BPA even below its no observed effect concentration (NOEC) level at the endpoint of 32 hr with no blood flow, and the level of the increase was influenced by the toxic unit (TU) ratio.",

There is no specific antidote to the poisoning; therefore treatment is supportive in nature including oxygen, fluid replacement, and most importantly, fever control. Reduce elevated body temperature by physical means. Administer sponge baths and use fans to increase evaporation. In fully conscious patients, administer cold, sugar-containing liquids by mouth as tolerated. Cooling blankets and ice packs to body surfaces may also be used. Antipyretic therapy with salicylates is strongly contraindicated as salicylates also uncouple oxidative phosphorylation. Other antipyretics are thought to be of no use because of the peripherally mediated mechanism of hyperthermia in poisoning of this nature. Neither the safety nor the effectiveness of the other antipyretics has been tested. Administer oxygen continuously by mask to minimize tissue anoxia. Unless there are manifestations of cerebral or pulmonary edema or of inadequate renal function, administer intravenous fluids to restore hydration and support physiologic mechanisms for heat loss and toxicant disposition. Monitor serum electrolytes, adjusting IV infusions to stabilize electrolyte concentrations. Follow urine contents of albumin and cells, and keep an accurate hourly record of intake/output to forestall fluid overload if renal function declines. Caution: In the presence of cerebral edema and/or impaired renal function, intravenous fluids must be administered very cautiously to avoid increased intracranial pressure and pulmonary edema. Central monitoring of venous and pulmonary wedge pressures may be indicated. Such critically ill patients should be treated in an intensive care unit.",

Measurement of retinal binding protein appears to be a better marker for early tubular dysfunction due to its stability in the urine subsequent to collection and analysis. However, retinal binding protein is produced in the liver and not a constitutive protein of the kidney, so that its presence in the kidney provides only indirect evidence of tubular damage.",

Damage to epithelial cell membranes can result in the increased excretion of these isoenzymes in the urine. This test for assessing renal tubular damage appears to have many advantages over other available tests, such as: (1) the alpha and pi isoenzymes are constitutive proteins in the kidney; (2) these isoenzymes are stable in the urine, (3) the test is simple and reproducible; and (4) due to selective localization of the isoenzymes, differential diagnosis of specific tubular damage is possible. In addition, increased levels of these isoenzymes were seen in patients previously exposed to nephrotoxicants where conventional tests for kidney function were normal, indicating a high degree of sensitivity.",

Signs of acute toxicity included ataxia developing about 15 min after dosing, followed by rapidly developing motor weakness, hyperpyrexia, and rapid breathing about 25 min after dosing. Most deaths occurred either between 20 min and 2 hr, or between 4 hr and 8 hr following dosing. Those animals who recovered had little salivation, rectal temperatures only 1 to 3 Â°F above normal, and began to recover after 8 hr. Rats who were 10 to 20 days of age and not yet weaned and adult rats aged 70 to 134 days old formed the two most susceptible groups, far more susceptible than were juveniles aged 25 to 50 days, to the toxic effects of pentachlorophenol. The LD50 increased 4.4 times from postnatal day ten to postnatal day 25, plateaued from day 25 to 50, and decreased 2.8 times from day 50 to 134. The LD50 (mg/kg) ranged from 50 to 180 for preweaned rats, from 220 to 230 for juveniles (25-59 days old), and from 80 to 120 for adults (70-130 days old).

The chemicals responsible are presumably ingested when the bats groom their fur after they have been in contact with the treated timber. Bats prevented from establishing such bodily contact took longer to die indicating that absorption of the vapor phase of the tested chemicals also takes place across the skin or respiratory epithelium. Acrylic resin reduces the lethal effect when used as a sealant over wood treated with gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane and pentachlorophenol, but polyurethane varnish does not.",

Generally, reproductive and juvenile stages are the most sensitive, with LC50 values as low as 0.01 mg/L for fish larvae. Low levels of dissolved oxygen, low pH, and high temperature increase the toxic effects of PCP. Concentrations causing sublethal effects on fish are in the low g/L range. As PCP contamination in many surface waters is in this range, population and community effects cannot be ruled out. This is also indicated by the substantial alterations in the community structure of model ecosystems that are induced by PCP. PCP is accumulated by aquatic organisms. Fresh-water fish show bioconcentration factors of up to 1000 compared to <100 in marine fish. The portion of PCP taken up, either through the surrounding water or along the food chain, is probably species specific.",

When tested for cytogenetic effects in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, pentachlorophenol was weakly positive for induction of sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations. In the sister chromatid exchange test, a weakly positive response was observed within a concentration range of 3 to 30 ug/mL in the absence of S9; with S9, no induction of sister chromatid exchanges was noted. In the chromosomal aberrations test, pentachlorophenol was negative without S9 but induced small but significant increases in the frequency of aberrant cells in the presence of S9 at doses of 80 and 100 ug/mL. In contrast to the positive in vitro results in the test for induction of chromosomal aberrations, no increase was noted in bone marrow of male rats or mice administered pentachlorophenol by intraperitoneal injection three times at 24 hour intervals. The highest dose administered to rats (75 mg/kg) and mice (150 mg/kg) was lethal.",

                          "String": "Pentachlorophenol's production may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams; its use as a wood preservative and surface disinfectant will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.1X10-4 mm Hg at 20 Â°C indicates pentachlorophenol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase pentachlorophenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 29 days. The chemical behavior of pentachlorophenol will depend on whether it exists primarily as the phenol under acidic conditions or the phenolate anion, under basic conditions. Pentachlorophenol has a pH-dependent absorption max of 303 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, pentachlorophenol is expected to have low to no mobility based upon measured Koc values ranging from 1250 for the dissociated form to 25,000 for the undissociated form. The pKa of pentachlorophenol is 4.70, indicating that this compound will almost entirely exist in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the acid exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. As much as 55% of added pentachlorophenol was photodegraded in a sandy clay loam soil in 14 days, suggesting the photolysis of the dissociated form may be an important terrestrial fate process. Pentachlorophenol may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Screening biodegradability tests give conflicting results; pentachlorophenol does biodegrade but may require several weeks for acclimation. If released into water, pentachlorophenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon its measured Koc values. The pKa indicates pentachlorophenol will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. BCF values from approximately 5 to 5000 indicate that bioconcentration of pentachlorophenol in aquatic organisms is low to high, with the value being greatly influenced by environmental pH. Bioconcentration is expected to be pH dependent with greater accumulation at lower pH values. Pentachlorophenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Pentachlorophenol has a pH-dependent absorption max of 303 nm and will photodegrade rapidly in surface water when exposed to direct sun light with a measured half-life of 0.86 hrs reported. Occupational exposure to pentachlorophenol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where pentachlorophenol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to pentachlorophenol via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound. Once used in tremendous volumes as an insecticide and fungicide in preserving wood products, pentachlorophenol is being phased out as polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans have been found to be impurities associated with the manufacturing process as well as the sensitive detection methods that have been applied.

The pKa of pentachlorophenol is 4.70(3), indicating that this compound will almost entirely exist in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the acid exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Pentachlorophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 1.1X10-4 mm Hg at 25 Â°C(5). As much as 55% of added pentachlorophenol was photodegraded in a sandy clay loam soil in 14 days(6), suggesting the photolysis of the dissociated form may be an important terrestrial fate process(SRC). Screening biodegradability tests give conflicting results(7-13); pentachlorophenol does biodegrade but may require several weeks for acclimation(SRC).",

A pKa of 4.70(3) indicates pentachlorophenol will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(4). According to a classification scheme(5), measured BCF values of 5(6) to 5370(7), suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to very high(SRC), with the value being greatly influenced by environmental pH(8). Pentachlorophenol has a pH-dependent absorption max of 303 nm(9) and will rapidly photodegrade in surface water when exposed to direct sun light(10); a measured half-life for the photolysis in solution has been reported to be 0.86 hrs(11). Screening biodegradability tests give conflicting results(12-18); pentachlorophenol does biodegrade but may require several weeks for acclimation(SRC).",

Replicate streams were dosed continuously at pentachlorophenol concns of 0, 48, and 144 ug/L, respectively, for an 88 day period during the summer of 1983. Pentachlorophenol was degraded both aerobically and anaerobically. Aerobic degradation was more rapid than anaerobic degradation. Mineralization of pentachlorophenol was concommitant with pentachlorophenol disappearance under aerobic conditions, but lagged behind loss of the parent molecule under anaerobic conditions. Biodegradation in the streams, or in specific stream compartments such as the sediment or water column, was characterized by an adaptation period (3-5 weeks for the stream as a whole, and reproducible from the previous year), which was inversely dependent on the concn of pentachlorophenol and microbial biomass. The adaptation in the streams could be attributed to the time necessary for selective enrichment of an initially low population of pentachlorophenol degraders on surface compartments. The extent of biodegradation in the streams (percent loss of initial concn of pentachlorophenol) increased with increasing pentachlorophenol input, which was explicable by an increase in the pentachlorophenol degrader population with increasing pentachlorophenol concn. The sediment zone most significant to overall pentachlorophenol biodegradation was the top 0.5 to 1 cm layer as shown by pentachlorophenol migration rates and depth profiles of degrader density within the sediment. Pentachlorophenol profiles in sediment cores taken during and after the adaptation period for degradation showed that diffusion of pentachlorophenol into the sediment was rate limiting to degradation in this compartment.",

Vapor-phase pentachlorophenol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 29 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 0.55X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 Â°C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Pentachlorophenol has a pH-dependent absorption max of 303 nm(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight.",

Pentachlorophenol, present at 100 mg/L, reached 1% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(9). Acclimation of microbial communities to pentachlorophenol appears to increase tolerance to pentachlorophenol and/or select for pentachlorophenol-tolerant microorganisms(10). Pentachlorophenol, at an initial concn of 300-500 ug/L, had a half-life of 2.6 days using a sludge inoculum(11). At this concentration, no lag phase was seen(11).",

A lag period of 11 days with complete degradation by day 17 was reported for the non-adapted culture; the lag period was 9 days with complete degradation by 13 days for the adapted culture(1). Intermediate products of 3,5-dichlorophenol, 3,4,5-trichlorophenol, 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenol were reported(1). Increasing the concn of pentachlorophenol, from 1 to 10 mg/L, increased the time required for complete biodegradation. Complete biodegradation at pH 7 and 8 required 13 and 3 days, respectively; only 20% biodegradation was reported by day 19 for cultures incubated at pH 6(1). Anaerobic biodegradation of a pentachlorophenol-contaminated soil resulted in an initial increase in pentachlorophenol concns due to desorption; this was followed by a period of dechlorination giving 2,3,4,5- and 2,3,5,6-tetrachlorophenol as initial metabolites(2). No biodegradation occurred in anaerobic clay loam soil with no added nutrients(3). Other studies in soil have suggested greater biodegradation under anaerobic conditions producing pentachloroanisole and tri- and tetrachlorophenols(4,5). The order of pentachlorophenol dechlorination in anaerobic sediment is ortho to produce 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenol, ortho to produce 3,4,5-trichlorophenol, meta to produce 2,4-dichlorophenol, and para or ortho to produce 2-chlorophenol or 4-chlorophenol(6).",

A measured half-life for the photolysis of pentachlorophenol in solution has been reported to be 0.86 hrs(7). In water at pH 7.3, 90% degradation occurred in 10 hr with sunlight while at pH 3 (mostly undissociated form), 40% degradation occurred in 90 hr(2). Reported half-lives for photodegradation of the dissociated form have included 0.2 hr (10 cm deep)(1), 3.5 hr(2), 4.75 hr (300 cm deep)(1), and 10 days(3). Products of photodegradation include 2,3-dichloromaleic acid, 2,3,5,6- and 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol, tetrachlororesorcinol, tetrachlorocatechol(4), benzoquinones(2,3), and possibly dioxins(5). Photolysis in a solution of H2O-CH3CN using 290 nm wavelengths and a pH of 12 produces the photoproduct 2-methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrachlorobenazole(6). Half-lives of 24 minutes, 30.9 minutes, and 635 minutes were reported for aqueous solutions of pentachlorophenol under direct sunlight, under a clear plastic sheet, and under a black plastic sheet, respectively(9). As much as 55% of added pentachlorophenol was photodegraded in a sandy clay loam soil in 14 days with conditions present to increase rates of evaporative flux(9). Little loss of pentachlorophenol was noted in dry soils or soils covered with black plastic. Photodegradation rates are lower than aqueous rates due to the attenuation of light by natural chromophores(9). A second-order rate constant of 9.36X10+7 per M-sec was reported for the reaction of pentachlorophenol with singlet oxygen(10).",

Passive uptake of pentachlorophenol was reported in Chironomus riparius, a midge; uptake was greater when sediment was present(3). A BCF value of 458 was measured in Chironomus riparius (midge) exposed to pentachlorophenol at 9 ug/L in a 16 hour static phase; a depuration rate was determined in a flow-through system at 55 mL/g-hr(4).

According to a classification scheme(2), these Koc values indicate that pentachlorophenol is expected to have slight to no mobility in soil(SRC). Freundlich isotherm coefficients were determined to be 5 (silty sand soil), 5 (aquifer), and 3 (marine sediment)(9). A log Koc of 3.16 was observed in sediment of the Yangtse River in China(10). Since pentachlorophenol has a pKa of 4.70(3), its adsorptivity will be strongly dependent on pH. The Freundlich adsorption constant for 6 Dutch soils are (soil (% organic carbon, pH) log KF, 1/N): humic sand (1.7%, 3.4) 2.2, 0.9; humic sand (2.2%, 4.9) 2.2, 0.9; humic-rich sand (3.2%, 4.7) 2.6, 1.0; peat (29.8%, 4.6) 3.3, 0.8; light loam (0.9%, 7.5) 1.1, 0.9; heavy loam (1.7%, 7.1) 1.5, 0.8(4). For loam soil where pH >pKa, significant contribution from the phenolate ion can be expected. The Koc values for the total dissociated phenol was calculated to be 1250 and 1800 for light and heavy loam, respectively, while for the undissociated species, the Koc is 25,000(5). The fraction of pentachlorophenol which is sorbed decreases linearly with pH to a pH 6; above pH 6, significant adsorption of the anion again occurs, contributing as much as 20% of the total adsorption effect at pH 8(4). K values for a Bjuv clay (organic carbon 12%) and an aquifer soil (organic carbon 0.02%) were 433 and 86 at pH 3.0, respectively, and 167 and 50 at pH 6.5, respectively(4). K values for a bentonite clay of 72 and 34 were measured at pH 3.0 and 6.5, respectively(4). The nonionized form of pentachlorophenol had a K value of 3.63 mL/g in a sandy aquifer material (organic C 0.13%) (Koc 2792)(6). K values measured at pH 7 for a Guishan sandy loam (organic carbon 1.4%) and a Shulin clay loam (organic carbon 2.0%) were 2.56 (Koc 183) and 7.03 (Koc 352), respectively(7). The Koc for pentachlorophenol was measured for five soils (foc from 0.07 to 2.96%; 3 sands, 1 loamy sand, 1 loam)(8). At pH 4, 7, and 10, the Koc values ranged from 10091-40120 (avg 19675), 178-1956 (avg 651), and 126-942 (avg 501), respectively(8).",

This agrees with a field study in an artificial stream in which <0.006% of the added pentachlorophenol was lost by volatilization(2). The chemical behavior of pentachlorophenol will depend on whether it exists primarily as the phenol under acidic conditions or the phenolate anion, under basic conditions(3) and also temperature(4); at pH 5, the half-life from water surfaces is 328 hours (30 Â°C) while at pH 6, the half-life is 3120 hours(4). Also reported was a 25-51% of added pesticide-formulated pentachlorophenol detected in the air in terrestrial microcosms(5,6,7). Pentachlorophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure of 1.1X10-4 mm Hg(8).",

In Oregon, 1.4% of tested wells contained pentachlorophenol and the max concn was 0.12 ppb(2). Concns of pentachlorophenol in groundwater were 1047 and 152 ppb at Havertown pentachlorophenol site, Havertown, PA(3) and Doepke disposal site, Holliday, KS, respectively(4). The leaking of pentachlorophenol from a sawmill dip tank in British Columbia resulted in the contamination of a shallow aquifer at peak concns of 20 to 63 mg/L; the nearby Okanagan River received contaminated groundwater with a travel time of 47 days (for 122 m distance)(5). Groundwater from Visalia, CA was heavily contaminated with pentachlorophenol(6). At the Pensacola site, a former wood treatment plant in Florida resulted in the contamination of an underlying aquifer with pentachlorophenol at concns from 0.0 to 3.53 mg/L(6). Pentachlorophenol was detected at a max concn of 40 ug/L in the Biscayne aquifer study area(7). Pentachlorophenol was detected in one groundwater supply site in Atlantic Canada at 11 ug/L(8).

At several freshwater and marine sites in British Columbia, Canada, which received effluents from the wood-treatment industry, avg pentachlorophenol levels in the sediments ranged from not detectable to 590 ug/kg, while the corresponding range for the overlying waters was from not detectable to 7.3 ug/L(7). Pentachlorophenol concns in sediments upstream from the Kinleith pulp and paper mill ranged from 0.5 to 5.5 ng/g; downstream concns ranged from 11 to 13 ng/g near to the mill and from 0.41 to 1.6 ng/g further downstream(8). Pentachlorophenol was present in sediment collected from sediment traps placed both upstream and downstream from a pulp mill in Finland; upstream concns ranged from 0.05 to 0.06 and downstream concns from 0.04 to 0.06 ug/g dry matter(9). Sediment concns at the same sampling locations contained pentachlorophenol at 0.040 to 0.050 ug/g dry matter at upstream locations and from 0.060 to 0.110 ug/g dry matter at downstream locations(9). A marine sediment was collected in a harbor of a naval station on the west coast of Norway contained pentachlorophenol at unreported concentrations(10). Concentrations of pentachlorophenol ranged from 0.012 to 0.227 ug/g dry weight in the sediment of Pyhaoja Brook, Finland; this stream has been apparently affected by the operation of a sawmill(11). Sediment samples collected from 3 sites of a bleached kraft mill in New Zealand; the basin of the bleached kraft mill effluent treatment lagoon, from a location in the effluent drain midway between this basin and the effluent outfall point, and from a location immediately downstream of the outfall point contained pentachlorophenol at 1045, 173, and 160.0 ug of Cl/g dry weight(12). Sediment samples taken from the Huaihe River, China in 2002 contained concns of 0.19, 0.17, 0.09, and 0.11 mg/kg(13). Sediment sampled in 1998 from Dongting Lake, China (previously treated with Na-pentachlorophenate until 1996), contained pentachlorophenol concns ranging between 0.18 and 48.3 ug/L(14).",

All urine samples from 197 Arkansas children contained pentachlorophenol(2). The median and max pentachlorophenol concn was 14 and 240 ppb. All 87 urine samples collected randomly in Saskatchewan, Canada, contained pentachlorophenol at concentrations from 0.5 to 9.1 ng/mL (detection limit = 0.2 ng/mL; avg = 1.6 ng/mL and median = 1.3 ng/mL)(3). A second study of 38 urine samples from \"normal, healthy\" humans living in Saskatchewan, Canada, reported pentachlorophenol concentrations from 0.1 to 3.6 ng/mL with an average concentration of 0.9 ng/mL and a median concentration of 0.5 ng/mL(3). Levels in samples of seminal fluid obtained from volunteer Florida State University students have been reported as 100-200 ppb(4) and in adipose tissue obtained from autopsy samples from the University of Florida at 250-500 ppb(4) and 23 ppb in autopsy samples taken in 10 women from Dade County, FL(5). The mean levels of pentachlorophenol in samples collected from the general population in Barcelona, Spain, in 1982-83 were 25 ng/mL (50 samples) in urine and 21.9 ng/mL (100 samples) in serum(6).",

The study group consisted of 35 persons exposed to pentachlorophenol in six workplaces and 123 persons living in 45 homes constructed of pentachlorophenol treated logs. The comparisons consisted of 143 persons living in conventional homes and not occupationally exposed to pentachlorophenol. Urine and blood samples were collected and analyzed for pentachlorophenol. Among the comparisons, urine pentachlorophenol concentrations ranged from 1 to 17 ppb, mean 3.4 ppb. Serum samples from 34 comparisons ranged from 15 to 75 ppb, mean 40 ppb. In persons living in pentachlorophenol treated log homes, serum pentachlorophenol concentrations ranged from 69 to 1340 ppb, mean 420 ppb. The serum pentachlorophenol concns decreased with increasing age. Subjects in the 2 to 7 year old group had significantly higher serum pentachlorophenol concns than those over 15 years old. The serum pentachlorophenol concentrations in children 2 to 15 years old averaged 1.7 to 2.0 times that of their parents. Repeat blood samples taken from ten persons residing in homes in which the logs were coated with a sealant showed that sealing the logs resulted in decreased serum pentachlorophenol concentrations. Urine pentachlorophenol concns ranged from 1 to 340 ppb, mean 69 ppb. When the urine pentachlorophenol concns were corrected for creatinine concns, they correlated well with the serum pentachlorophenol concns. Serum pentachlorophenol concentrations in the pentachlorophenol workers ranged from 26 to 84900 ppb. The lowest concentrations occurred in workers constructing homes from pentachlorophenol treated logs and the highest in workers exposed to pentachlorophenol in chemical factories. Urine pentachlorophenol concentrations in four workers ranged from 2400 to 13800 ppb, mean 10000 ppb(1).",
