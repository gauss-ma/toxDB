The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

                      "String": "The relationship between the metabolism and the toxicity of ortho-dichlorobenzene was investigated by evaluating its biotransformation, tissue distribution, blood kinetics and excretion after oral administration of 5, 50 or 250 mg/kg bw to male Wistar rats. The dose of 250 mg/kg bw had been demonstrated to be toxic in previous studies. The major route of elimination of ortho-dichlorobenzene (75-85%) was via the kidneys; excretion in the feces represented 19% of the low dose and 7% of the high dose. Excretion was nearly complete within 24 hr after the low and intermediate doses and within 48 hr after the high dose. Pretreatment with phenobarbital accelerated excretion of the high dose and resulted in an overall higher proportion of urinary excretion. Biliary excretion constituted 50-60% of the dose, indicating significant enterohepatic recirculation. The highest concentrations of radiolabel after a low dose were found in fat, liver and kidney 6 hr after administration; these then declined rapidly. The maximal concentration in blood was reached 6-8 hr after administration of the low and intermediate doses and 24 hr after the high dose. ortho-Dichlorobenzene was detected in blood only during the first 2 hr after administration of 5 mg/kg bw. The major route of biotransformation was via the glutathione pathway, 60% of the urinary metabolites being mercapturic acids; the major metabolites in bile were also conjugates of glutathione. Other major metabolites in urine were the sulfate conjugates of 2,3- and 3,4- dichlorophenol. No significant differences in metabolic profiles were observed with dose. Induction with phenobarbital increased excretion of sulfate conjugates (30% in induced rats, 20% in control rats), the main one being the conjugate of 3,4-dichlorophenol. The mercapturic acids in urine and the glutathione conjugates in bile were epoxide-derived metabolites, and no quinone- or hydroquinone-derived metabolites were observed. A high dose of ortho-dichlorobenzene results in depletion of glutathione, followed by oxidative stress and possibly binding to macromolecules.",

In rats, absorption of 1,2-dichlorobenzene from the gastrointestinal tract was considered complete at doses of 5 and 50 mg/kg bw but incomplete (83% absorption) at 250 mg/kg bw. There are no quantitative data for the dermal and inhalation absorption of 1,2-dichlorobenzene in animals or absorption of the chemical via any route in humans. Studies with rats have shown that 1,2-dichlorobenzene is distributed primarily to the adipose tissue with lesser amounts detected in the kidneys, liver and plasma. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene equivalents were bound to the kidneys, liver and plasma with covalent binding accounting for a substantial proportion of bound material. In particular, ...non-specific covalent binding to the alpha2u-globulin fraction of the rat kidney /was observed/. Several studies have found that the administration of a single dose of 1,2-dichlorobenzene by either the oral, intraperitoneal or intravenous route results in high initial tissue levels of 1,2-dichlorobenzene equivalents. Peak tissue levels occur within 1 and 6 hours, depending on the method of administration, followed by rapid decline thereafter",

After administration of o-DCB to rats, swift decreases were observed in the concentrations of o-DCB in blood, liver, and kidneys, whereas 3,4-DCPSO2Me appeared in blood, liver, kidneys, and adipose tissue. The concentrations of 3,4-DCPSO2Me in the blood and three tissues reached maxima at 24 hr. Both aminopyrine N-demethylase and aniline hydroxylase activities and cytochrome P450 content of hepatic microsomes decreased 24 hr after administration of o-DCB. In contrast, 3,4-DCPSO2Me increased the activities of these enzymes and cytochrome P450 and b5 contents in rat liver microsomes. In both antibiotic-pretreated and bile duct-cannulated rats dosed with o-DCB, the concentrations of 2,3- and 3,4-DCPSO2Mes in blood, liver, kidneys, and adipose tissue were dramatically reduced. These findings suggest that the process of formation of methylsulfonyl metabolites of o-DCB involves biliary secretion of DCPSO2Mes and/or their precursors which will be subjected to metabolism by intestinal microflora. In antibiotic-pretreated rats, the inhibitory effects of o-DCB administration on the activities of aminopyrine- and aniline-metabolizing enzymes and the contents of cytochromes P450 and b5 in hepatic microsomes were greater than those observed in the intact rats. In bile duct-cannulated rats, the decrease in aminopyrine N-demethylase activity after administration of o-DCB was greater than that observed in the intact rats. These findings suggest that the apparent inhibition of drug-metabolizing enzymes by o-DCB is the result of simultaneous contrary effects, namely, the inductive effect of 3,4-DCPSO2Me and the stronger inhibitory effect of an unknown factor(s) on drug-metabolizing enzymes.",

Conjugation of the epoxides with glutathione was predominantly non-enzymatic in rats, whereas in humans conjugation was catalysed almost exclusively by glutathione S-transferases. This difference may be due to formation of a 'non-reactive' 3,4-epoxide by CYP 2E1 in human microsomes: incubation with microsomes that selectively express human CYP 2E1 or with human liver microsomes resulted in the formation of similar amounts of 2,3- and 3,4-dichlorophenol and two glutathione-epoxides in equal amounts. In rat microsomes, one major glutathione-epoxide conjugate was found, with a much higher covalent binding index, particularly for the phenobarbital-induced microsomes. The authors suggested that rat CYP 2B1/2 preferentially oxidizes the 4,5 site of ortho-dichlorobenzene, while human CYP 2E1 forms predominantly the 'non-reactive' 3,4-epoxide. They concluded that the risk for liver toxicity due to exposure to 1,2-dichlorobenzene will be overestimated when it is based solely on toxicity in rats.",

The rate of conversion was 0.09 nmol/min per mg protein in both Wistar and Fischer 344 rat microsomes, 0.04 in Sprague-Dawley microsomes and 0.14 in human microsomes. Induction of Wistar rats with isoniazid, a CYP 2E1 inducer, or phenobarbital, a CYP 2B1/2 inducer, resulted in increased conversion rates of 0.20 and 0.42 nmol/min per mg protein, respectively. Covalent binding of radiolabel to microsomal proteins was similar in Wistar, Fischer and isoniazid-treated Wistar rats (16-17% of total metabolites), whereas induction with phenobarbital resulted in a slightly increased covalent binding rate of 23% of total metabolites. The covalent binding rate was 31% in Sprague-Dawley microsomes but only 4.6% in human microsomes. Ascorbic acid reduced covalent binding only in Sprague-Dawley microsomes, indicating that quinones are probably major contributors to macromolecular binding in these microsomes. Conjugation of epoxides with glutathione inhibited most covalent binding in all microsomes. In the absence of glutathione, the epoxides were hydrolysed by epoxide hydrolase to dihydrodiols, and inhibition of epoxide hydrolase increased the covalent binding for all microsomes tested, indicating a role of epoxides in the covalent binding. The finding that Fischer 344 rat liver microsomes had less epoxide hydrolase activity than microsomes from Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats may explain the greater sensitivity of rats of this strain to the hepatotoxicity of ortho-dichlorobenzene in vivo. Conjugation of the epoxides with glutathione was predominantly non-enzymatic in rats, whereas in humans conjugation was catalysed almost exclusively by glutathione S-transferases. This difference may be due to formation of a 'non-reactive' 3,4-epoxide by CYP 2E1 in human microsomes: incubation with microsomes that selectively express human CYP 2E1 or with human liver microsomes resulted in the formation of similar amounts of 2,3- and 3,4-dichlorophenol and two glutathione-epoxides in equal amounts. In rat microsomes, one major glutathione-epoxide conjugate was found, with a much higher covalent binding index, particularly for the phenobarbital-induced microsomes. The authors suggested that rat CYP 2B1/2 preferentially oxidizes the 4,5 site of ortho-dichlorobenzene, while human CYP 2E1 forms predominantly the 'non-reactive' 3,4-epoxide. They concluded that the risk for liver toxicity due to exposure to 1,2-dichlorobenzene will be overestimated when it is based solely on toxicity in rats.",

Two oxidative events in the liver contribute to 1,2-DCB-induced liver injury: an initial hepatocellular oxidative stress, followed by oxidant stress associated with an inflammatory response. We hypothesize that the initial hepatocellular oxidative event triggers molecular and cellular processes within hepatocytes that lead to the production of factors that contribute to Kupffer cell (KC) activation and upregulation of the inflammatory cascade. To investigate the molecular effects of 1,2-DCB, primary cultures of Fischer-344 (F-344) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat hepatocytes were incubated with 1,2-DCB (3.6-12.4 umol) and examined for enhanced DNA-binding activity of the oxidant-sensitive transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), and electrophile responsive element (EpRE), and production and release of the chemokine cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC). In F-344 rat hepatocytes, the activities of AP-1 and NF-kappaB were increased by as much as 3-fold by 6 h of 1,2-DCB treatment, when compared to control. Nuclear translocation of EpRE was also enhanced by 3-fold and occurred 2 h following 1,2-DCB treatment. These events were greater in F-344 than in SD rat hepatocytes incubated with 1,2-DCB. Moreover, F-344 rat hepatocytes produced and released CINC following incubation with 1,2-DCB, but SD rat hepatocytes did not. Lastly, conditioned media from 1,2-DCB-treated F-344 rat hepatocytes stimulated KC activity as determined by enhanced NF-kappaB-binding activity and increased nitric oxide production. Collectively, these data suggest that the mechanisms of 1,2-DCB-induced hepatotoxicity involve intercellular communication whereby compromised hepatocytes may signal KC activation via the production and release of oxidant-sensitive chemokines and cytokines.",

Although, hepatotoxic injury of o-DCB is greater in Fischer 344 (F344) when compared with Sprague Dawley (S-D) rats, this interstrain difference does not transcend into any difference in lethal effects of o-DCB. Interstrain difference in compensatory tissue repair has been suggested as the underlying mechanism for the lack of strain differences in lethality ... The objectives of the present study were (1) to investigate if the differences in compensatory tissue repair are reflected in differential protooncogene expression in S-D versus F344 rat livers and (2) to investigate if changes in protooncogene expression could explain the decrease and delay in tissue repair response beyond a threshold of 0.6 mL o-DCB/kg. Male S-D and F344 rats (8/9 weeks old) were administered either 0.6 or 1.2 mL o-DCB/kg and changes in expression of protooncogenes c-myc (immediate early) and Ha-ras (delayed early) were examined over a time course. Findings of this study indicate that the timing and extent of c-myc and Ha-ras expression varies in the two strains following administration of o-DCB. ...",

There is substantial evidence that para-dichlorobenzene induces these tumors through an alpha2u-globulin-associated response. Although para-dichlorobenzene does not bind to DNA in the male rat kidney, there is weak evidence that it binds to DNA in several tissues in treated mice. Both ortho- and para-dichlorobenzene have been reported to bind to proteins and DNA in the same mouse tissues. No attempt was made to isolate any DNA adducts. The data available on the genotoxicity of para-dichlorobenzene and ortho-dichlorobenzene also do not allow any distinction to be made between these two compounds, which differ significantly in their tumorigenicity: ortho-dichlorobenzene does not cause tumors, whereas para-dichlorobenzene causes liver tumors in mice and kidney tumors in male rats. Overall, the data on genotoxicity do not support a mechanism for renal-cell tumor induction in rats involving direct interaction of para-dichlorobenzene with DNA. Therefore, the overall data, including those on genotoxicity, indicate that para-dichlorobenzene causes renal tumors in male rats through an alpha2u-globulin associated response.",

Volatile compounds were analyzed in a glass column coated with 6% SP-2100 plus 4% OV-11 on Chromosorb W Semivolatile compounds, chlorinated compounds and pesticides were analyzed in a 70 m glass capillary column coated with 5% OV-101. Phenols were analyzed in a glass column packed with 1% SP-1240 DA on Supelcoport. The most efficient means of separation was to use the same glass column for volatile compounds, a DB-5 fused silica capillary column for semivolatile compounds, pesticides and phenols, and the same 1% SP-1240 DA glass column for separation of beta-BHC and pentachlorophenol.

SKIN: IMMEDIATELY flood affected skin with water while removing and isolating all contaminated clothing. Gently wash all affected skin areas thoroughly with soap and water. If symptoms such as redness or irritation develop, IMMEDIATELY call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital for treatment.  INHALATION: IMMEDIATELY leave the contaminated area; take deep breaths of fresh air. If symptoms (such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or burning in the mouth, throat, or chest) develop, call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital. Provide proper respiratory protection to rescuers entering an unknown atmosphere. Whenever possible, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) should be used; if not available, use a level of protection greater than or equal to that advised under Protective Clothing.  INGESTION: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. If the victim is conscious and not convulsing, give 1 or 2 glasses of water to dilute the chemical and IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center. Be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital if advised by a physician. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, ensure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body.

FIRE INVOLVING TANKS OR CAR/TRAILER LOADS: Fight fire from maximum distance or use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles. Do not get water inside containers. Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire. For massive fire, use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2016)",

Adequate mixing in the collection chamber was accomplished by externally agitating the ASTM cell at the required speed in a moving-tray water bath at 25 Â°C. The Viton glove did not show permeation even after 4 hr. The nitrile gloves showed breakthrough times of < 1 hr. The steady state molar flux rates for unsupported or supported nitrile gloves, or for the different challenge solvents were not statistically different. Breakthrough times were better indicators of permeation than steady state molar flux rates. A mixed permeation mechanism was proposed, depending on swelling of the glove material.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA, as amended in 1988, were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene is found on List C. Case No: 3057; Pesticide type: Antimicrobial; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered ... The case /is characterized/ as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI): 1,2-Dichlorobenzene; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered pesticide products ... \"cancelled.\"",

Administration of either compound dramatically reduced the severity of ortho-dichlorobenzene-induced liver injury, and both agents reduced the increase in plasma alanine aminotransferase activity by 80%; light microscopic examination confirmed that the reductions in enzyme activity reflected protection from hepatocellular injury. Interestingly, methyl palmitate did not protect against ortho-dichlorobenzene-induced hepatotoxicity in phenobarbital-pretreated rats, and the degree of inhibition of hepatotoxicity by polyethylene glycol-superoxide dismutase was not significantly different from that in normal rats. The lack of significant inhibition of phenobarbital-potentiated hepatotoxicity by both polyethylene glycol-superoxide dismutase and methyl palmitate suggests that reactive oxygen species released from a non-parenchymal source are not as crucial to the hepatotoxicity of ortho-dichlorobenzene in phenobarbital-pretreated as in the normal rats. The results suggest that reactive oxygen species released from Kupffer cells play a major role in the progression of orthodichlorobenzene hepatotoxicity.",

                          "String": "... 1,2-Dichlorobenzene has been shown to cause eye and respiratory irritation in humans at exposure levels above 100 ppm. Skin irritation has been observed following dermal application in humans and animals. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene is absorbed via the oral route. Absorption via the dermal or inhalation routes is poorly characterized. Inhalation is expected to be the major route for human exposure. The available toxicological data indicate that metabolic profiles and effects from 1,2-dichlorobenzene exposure are similar in rats, mice and humans. Animal studies with rats and mice have shown 1,2-dichlorobenzene to induce acute hepatotoxic effects. The LD50 for a single oral exposure to 1,2-dichlorobenzene for the rat ranges from 1516 to 2138 mg/kg bw. The LC100 for the rat is </= 977 ppm (5.9 mg/L) for a 10 hour exposure. During a 4 hour exposure, 1 of 20 rats died at 941 ppm (5.6 mg/L). In humans, the acute effects of 1,2-dichlorobenzene by ingestion or inhalation are reported to be headache, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, malaise and unconsciousness. Several oral studies of rats and mice ranging from 10 days to 2 years duration indicate that the adverse effects include increases in liver and kidney weights and hepatotoxicity. From these repeat dose studies, the NOAEL for non-neoplastic effects was 60 mg/kg bw, while the LOAEL was 120 mg/kg bw due to increased renal tubular regeneration in male mice. In several microbial organisms and mammalian systems, 1,2-dichlorobenzene tested negative in vitro. However, it did induce sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese Hamster ovary cells and increased mutation frequency in mouse lymphoma cells, both in the presence of metabolic activation. 1,2-dichlorobenzene was negative in several in vivo mammalian tests, except one of two micronuclei assays in mouse bone marrow was positive. In a two-year oral study in rats and mice, 1,2-dichlorobenzene was considered not to be carcinogenic (maximum dose of 120 mg/kg bw). In an inhalation 2-generation reproduction study in rats, no fertility effects were observed and reduced pup weight during lactation occurred at doses toxic to adults. The NOAEL and LOAEL (kidney and liver effects) for adult rats were 50 (0.3 mg/L) and 150 ppm (0.6 mg/L) respectively. In developmental studies in rats and rabbits, developmental effects were only seen in rats at maternally toxic doses (400 ppm, 2.4 mg/L). No human epidemiological studies have been conducted. ... 1,2-Dichlorobenzene has been tested on a wide range of aquatic organisms under acute exposure, although chronic data are scarce. Results for fish ranged from 96 hr LC50=1.58 mg/L for rainbow trout to 57 mg/L for fathead minnow. Both acute and chronic toxicity to aquatic invertebrates were obtained with two results showing high acute toxicity, namely EC50's of 0.78 mg/L and 0.66 mg/L to Daphnia and Ceriodaphnia respectively. Results from exposure to algae showed EC50 values in the 1-100 mg/L range for 1,2-dichlorobenzene. Toxicity to microorganisms can be considered slight. Although the major compartment expected to be exposed to 1,2-dichlorobenzene is the atmosphere, there are no ecotoxicity results available for organisms exposed through the gas phase. The chlorine substituents on the chemical suggest a potential for effects on stratospheric ozone. However, the chemical is unlikely to persist long enough to escape the troposphere, although it may persist long enough to undergo long range atmospheric transport. While there are a large number of acute data covering all trophic levels, chronic data are scarce. Therefore, an assessment factor of 100 has been chosen. The result used for determining the PNEC was the lowest chronic value obtained, i.e. 21 d NOEC = 0.63 mg/L for Daphnia magna. The PNECaquatic was therefore determined to be 6.3 ug/L.",

The method, applied to 57 chemicals, demonstrated that it could be used to detect the chemicals at low concentrations rapidly and with ease. The EC50 values showed a good relationship with 48 hr LC50 values for Himedaka (Oryzias latipes), and could be explained on the basis of the partition coefficient between water and n-octanol. EC50 for o-dichlorobenzene was 51 mg/L (350 umol/L).",

Embryos were reared in the presence of the agents for 48 hours, from the zygote to the pluteus larval stage. In addition, sperm inactivation was tested by adding agents to sperm suspensions, which were then used to inseminate untreated eggs. Benzene treatment at 10(-6) molar (M) showed a significant increase in embryo developmental defects and an elevated metaphase to anaphase (M) ratio indicating partial metaphase block, but no increase in total mitotic aberrations (TMA). With CB, developmental defects were only increased above controls at 10(-4)M. CB increased the M/A ratio, and the percentage of anaphase aberrations (AA) increased significantly with 10(-5) and 10(-4)M. A dose related response was found for o-DCB in developmental defects and for M/A ratio increases. For m-DCB, developmental defects and mitotic abnormalities were strongly increased. Sperm inactivation tests produced entirely different results. Only o-DCB and p-DCB caused spermiotoxicity. Developmental defects in the offspring of pretreated sperm were significant for all compounds, but primarily for benzene and CB. However, CB and o-DCB caused clear inhibition of mitosis. TMA increased with benzene, m-DCB, and p-DCB. For AA, the greatest effect was observed for CB, with lesser effects for m-DCB, o-DCB, and benzene. Both CB and o-DCB caused a sharp decrease in active mitotic figures and in anaphase figures (increased M/A), so that the lack of increase in TMA did not necessarily reflect the absence of any effect. The authors conclude that the results show some distinct toxicity patterns for the different agents, thus pointing out the need to reconsider criteria for ranking toxicities, in order to utilize multiple toxic endpoints.

                          "String": "Two-year toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of 1,2-dichlorobenzene were conducted by administering the test chemical in corn oil gavage five times per week for 103 weeks to groups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice at doses of 60 and 120 mg/kg. Groups of 50 rats and 50 mice of each sex received corn oil by gavage on the same schedule and served as vehicle controls. Survivals of female rats, male mice, and female mice were comparable to those of the corresponding vehicle controls in the 2-year study, but survival of high dose male rats was (P<0.001) shorter than that of the vehicle controls. In this group there were three accidental deaths and five deaths probably due to the gavage process; in addition aspiration of 1,2-dichlorobenzene in corn oil into the lungs may have been a contributing factor to the deaths of 12 high dose male rats. The 120 mg/kg dose level of 1,2-dichlorobenzene did not affect body weight in rats or mice of either sex or survival of mice or female rats. An increase in tubular regeneration in the kidney of high dose male mice was observed in the 2-year study (control, 8/48, 17%; low dose, 12/50, 24%; high dose, 17/49, 35%). No other compound-related nonneoplastic histological lesions were noted in the 2-year study.  The incidence of pheochromocytoma of the adrenal gland in low dose male rats was elevated (P<0.05, life table test) relative to controls (9/50, 16/50, 6/49). However, the incidence in the high dose group was lower than that of the controls and the dose-response trend was not statistically significant. Therefore, the increase in pheochromocytoma in the low dose male rats is not regarded as related to administration of 1,2-dichlorobenzene. A dose-related increase (P<0.05) in malignant histiocytic lymphoma was observed in male mice (control, 0/50, 0%; low dose, 1/50, 2%; high dose, 4/50, 8%) and in female mice (0/49, 0%; 0/50, 0%; 3/49, 6%); however, comparisons of the numbers of animals with all types of lymphomas is considered to be a more appropriate comparison. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene did not increase the incidence of all types of lymphomas (combined) in male mice (8/50, 16%; 2/50, 4%; 4/50, 8%) or female mice (11/49, 22%; 11/50, 22%; 13/49, 27%). Therefore, the increase in histiocytic lymphomas was discounted. Under the conditions of these two-year gavage studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity of 1,2-dichlorobenzene for male or female F344/N rats or B6C3F1 mice receiving 60 or 120 mg/kg/day.",

Its former use as a herbicide, insecticide, and soil fumigant, resulted in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, 1,2-dichlorobenzene will exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere, based on a vapor pressure of 1.4 mm Hg at 25 Â°C. Vapor-phase 1,2-dichlorobenzene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 38 days. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to undergo direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,2-dichlorobenzene is expected to have moderate mobility based upon Koc values of 280 and 320. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based on the Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-3 atm-cu m/mole at 20 Â°C. Volatilization of 1,2-dichlorobenzene from dry soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon the vapor pressure of this compound and a volatilization half-life of about 4 days measured in silt loams. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene is resistant to biodegradation in soils, with half-lives expected to be greater than 9 months. If released to water, 1,2-dichlorobenzene is expected to adsorb to sediment or particulate matter based on its measured Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important environmental fate process given this compounds Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 and 120 hours, respectively. BCF values in the range of 90 to 560 measured in fish, suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate to high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,2-dichlorobenzene is produced or used. Monitoring data suggest the general population may be exposed to 1,2-dichlorobenzene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water. (SRC)",

This value indicates that 1,2-dichlorobenzene will volatilize from water(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as approximately 4 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as approximately 120 hours(SRC). 1,2-Dichlorobenzene's Henry's Law constant(1) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based on a vapor pressure of 1.4 mm Hg at 25 Â°C(3). The volatilization half-life of 1,2-dichlorobenzene from Captina and McLaurin sandy loam soils was measured as about 4 days(4).",
