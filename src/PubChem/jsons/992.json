Acute inhalation exposures in humans have resulted in neurological, blood, and liver effects, and eye irritation. Chronic (long-term) exposure to pentachlorophenol by inhalation in humans has resulted in effects on the respiratory tract, blood, kidney, liver, immune system, eyes, nose, and skin. Human studies are inconclusive regarding pentachlorophenol exposure and reproductive effects. Human studies suggest an association between exposure to pentachlorophenol and cancer. Oral animal studies have reported increases in liver tumors and two uncommon tumor types. EPA has classified pentachlorophenol as a Group B2, probable human carcinogen.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example \"H2SO4\" for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version \"H2O4S.\"",

During the period 2002-2004, cord blood specimens were collected in parallel with maternal specimens from women delivering in the two eastern Slovak districts of Michalovce and Svidnik/Stropkov. A total of 92 pairs of mother-cord specimens at delivery were selected for this study. 4-OH-CB107, 3-OH-CB153, 4-OH-CB146, 3'-OH-CB138, 4-OH-CB187, and 4'-OH-CB172 were quantified. The median concentrations of Sigma(17)PCBs, Sigma(6)OH-PCBs, and PCP in cord serum were 0.92, 0.33, and 0.69 ng/g wet wt, respectively, and highly correlated with the corresponding maternal serum levels (correlations were R(2) = 0.61, 0.78, and 0.82, respectively). The median cord to mother ratios of the Sigma(17)PCBs, Sigma(6)OH-PCBs, and PCP were 0.18, 0.75, and 1.10, respectively. The median ratio of the Sigma(6)OH-PCBs to the Sigma(17) PCBs in the cord serum was 0.38 from wet wt based concn, which was about four times higher than the ratio of these compounds in maternal serum (0.09). PCP was more abundant than any PCB or OH-PCB congener measured in cord serum. The higher cord to maternal ratios of OH-PCB metabolites as compared with the parent cmpd suggests either a higher placental transfer rate or greater metabolism in the fetus as compared with the maternal compartment. These findings are consistent with their preferential binding to TTR that can cross the placenta. The cord to maternal ratio varies by congener (e.g., 4-OH-CB107 = 0.58, 4-OH-CB146 = 0.74, 3'-OH-CB138 = 1.01).",

Pentachlorophenol when incubated with microsomes, was converted into tetrachloro-1,2-hydroquinone and tetrachloro-1,4-hydroquinone. Isosafrole increased the rate of conversion 7 times as compared to control microsomes, while hexachlorobenzene, pentachlorophenol and 3-methylcholanthrene increased the rate of conversion 2 to 3 times. The fact that pentachlorophenol and hexachlorobenzene accounted for the production of tetrachloro-1,4-hydroquinone and tetrachloro-1,2-hydroquinone in a ratio of about 2, as compared to a ratio of about 1.3 for 3-methylcholanthrene and isosafrole, and the fact that this ratio decreased with increasing concentrations of pentachlorophenol in microsomes from hexachlorobenzene treated rats, were indicative of the involvement of the various cytochrome p450 isoenzymes. The covalent binding of pentachlorophenol to protein was inhibited by ascorbic acid, with a subsequent increase in the production of tetrachlorohydroquinones. The rate of covalent protein binding was constant, regardless of variation in the rate of conversion observed in the mirosomes of rats treated with various inducers. DNA binding was conversion dependent and was lower than protein binding. The addition of DNA did not affect the formation of soluble metabolites.",

                      "String": "The metabolism of pentachlorophenol in animals and man was reviewed. Tetrachlorophenols, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone, 2,3,4-trichlorophenol, 2,3,5-trichloro-1,4-hydroquinone, and their glucuronide conjugates were found in animals and man. Also identified were pentachlorophenylacetate, pentachloroanisole, and pentachlorophenylsulfate. The biotransformation of pentachlorophenol in man and animals takes place by conjugation, hydrolytic dechlorination, and reductive dechlorination. Further species dependent reactions are oxidation and methylation. The reaction with glutathione results in the formation of conjugates and cleavage of glycine and glutamate gives cysteine conjugates. Acetylation of the amino group of the cysteinyl moiety in mammals gives mercapturic acids. The metabolic pathways leading to dechlorinated derivatives may be mediated by the reaction with glutathione as the presence of the N-acetyl-S-(pentachlorophenyl)cysteine would indicate. The results of metabolic in vivo studies on hexachlorobenzene, pentachloronitrobenzene, pentachlorobenzene, and pentachlorophenol indicate that one pathway stems from hexachlorobenzene and pentachloronitrobenzene via sulfur containing conjugates to thiophenolic derivatives and to chlorinated benzenes, primarily to pentachlorobenzene. Another pathway transforms pentachlorophenol to less chlorinated phenols. The authors state that pentachlorophenol is a metabolite of various environmental chemicals and is itself metabolized. Therefore there is no direct relationship between the level of pentachlorophenol in body fluids and the degree of exposure.",

PCP binds to mitochondrial protein and inhibits mitochondrial ATP-ase activity. Thus, both the formation of ATP and the release of energy to the cell from the breakdown of ATP to ADP are prevented. Electron transport is not inhibited by PCP, although reactions dependent on available high-energy bonds, such as oxidative and glycolytic phosphorylation, are affected. Binding to enzymic protein has been reported and may lead to the inhibition of other cellular enzymes. There is an increase in cellular oxygen demand during the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. This causes the initial rise in respiration rate reported in individuals poisoned by PCP. PCP is toxic to the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. The toxicity of PCP is increased by impurities in some formulations. In some instances, it is very difficult to know whether the impurities have affected the poisoning. Dermatitis and chloracne are caused by contaminants such as PCDDs and PCDFs.",

Results from Western blot also shown /significant/ increases in the expression of cyclins D1, E and A and cdk4. The mitogenic response was also related to a /significant/ increase in the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb). PCP would cause apoptosis up-regulating the transcriptional activity of p53 gene and also increasing their activation by phosphorylation, concomitant with a decrease in the sirtuin 1 content. In conclusion, acute exposure of CGNs to PCP induces the classical p53 apoptotic pathway, promotes the up-regulation of several genes related to oxidative stress and the over-expression of molecules involved in the cell cycle control.",

Direct chlorination requires two steps: Chlorine gas is bubbled through liquid phenol, chlorophenol, or polychlorophenol at 30 - 40 °C to produce 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, which is then converted to PCP by further chlorination at a higher temperature in the presence of a catalyst, e.g., aluminum).The other method involves alkaline hydrolysis of hexachlorobenzene in methanol and dihydric alcohols, water, and solvents at 130 - 170 °C. A number of (very) toxic byproducts are produced in small quantities during the synthesis (e.g., polychlorinated dibenzofurans, chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins). This has led to severe restriction in the use of this compound in Western countries.",

However, pentachlorophenol is only one of many sources of CDDs, CDFs, and HCB in the environment making it difficult to quantify the portion of the aggregate environmental risk from CDDs, CDFs, and HCB that is attributable to pentachlorophenol ... CDDs and CDFs have been identified as micro-contaminants in technical grade pentachlorophenol. CDDs and CDFs have been found throughout the world at low concentrations in air, soil, water, sediment, fish and shellfish, and other food products such as meat and dairy products. CDDs and CDFs are members of a family of polychlorinated isomers of \"dioxin-like\" compounds. Physical and chemical properties and toxicity vary with the degree of chlorination. The most toxic congener of the family is 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD). The dioxin/furan contaminants of pentachlorophenol present a unique case for purposes of risk characterization. Up to 17 CDD/CDF congeners are produced as contaminants in the manufacture of technical grade pentachlorophenol. All of these contaminants have chlorine substitution in at least the 2,3,7, and 8 positions, thus imparting these contaminants with \"dioxin like\" activity. Thus, all must be considered in the risk assessment for the contaminants of pentachlorophenol. HCB has also been identified as a micro-contaminant in technical grade pentachlorophenol, and is not a naturally occurring compound. It is present in the environment through emissions into the atmosphere due to the manufacture of PCP and numerous emission processes, industrial discharge of HCB containing wastes into waterways as well as due to the manufacturing processes of some pesticides. Since HCB is a micro-contaminant in technical grade pentachlorophenol, it must also be considered in the risk assessment for the contaminants of pentachlorophenol.",

The second use is the long-term protection of wood from fungi by soaking it or permeating it in an autoclave with solvents containing pentachlorophenol at 3-5% concentration. Protection lasts 25-40 years. This is the only use of pentachlorophenol in the United States. Last is the treatment of heavy-duty textiles used in manufacturing cables, rigging, and tarpaulins. The treatment is based on the lauric ester of pentachlorophenol. This market is not large and no longer exists in the United States.",

Today, the use of PCP is restricted or forbidden in many countries not only because of its persistency in the environment but also because of the possible formation of highly toxic polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, particularly octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD), on heating PCP or incinerating PCP-treated wood, and the possible presence of dioxins as impurities in technical-grade PCP. Nevertheless, in the USA PCP is still a popular preservative for utility poles where it is applied dissolved in diesel oil by pressure treatment at retention levels of 5-8 kg/cu m of wood for pine species.",

New procedures for extraction and simultaneous monitoring of pentachlorophenol and palmitoylpentachlorophenol or a procedure designed that would hydrolyze palmitoylpentachlorophenol before extraction of pentachlorophenol would accurately assess pentachlorophenol exposure.",

Urine and water samples were digested at 100 °C for 1 hr in a sealed vial and later were extracted with toluene. Serum samples were acidified and then digested and extracted as above. Fish tissue washomogenized, acidified to pH 2, and rehomogenized; the emulsion was extracted with methylene chloride, extracted with alkali, and finally with toluene and digested as above. All samples were treated with an internal standard, diluted as appropriate, and subjected to gas chromatography at 300 °C using fused silica capillary columns. Samples were injected at 1 microliter volume and detection of compounds was facilitated by electron capture at 350 °C. A calibration standard of pure pentachlorophenol was run; the time of chromatographic run was 1 hr. Good resolution was achieved. Concentrations as low as 0.5 ppb wre detected by this method. The precision of the method was 1.2% for pentachlorophenol. The upper limit of detection was 200 ppb. Samples of water, urine, serum, and fish tissue contained a detectable concentration. Corrections were made to compensate for instrument drift. This method offers high sensitivity and precision for examining pentachlorophenol.",

It was primarily used as a wood preservative. Pentachlorophenol is extremely toxic to humans from acute (short-term) ingestion and inhalation exposure. Acute inhalation exposures in humans have resulted in neurological, blood, and liver effects, and eye irritation. Chronic (long-term) exposure to pentachlorophenol by inhalation in humans has resulted in effects on the respiratory tract, blood, kidney, liver, immune system, eyes, nose, and skin. Human studies are inconclusive regarding pentachlorophenol exposure and reproductive effects. Human studies suggest an association between exposure to pentachlorophenol and cancer. Oral animal studies have reported increases in liver tumors and two uncommon tumor types. EPA has classified pentachlorophenol as a Group B2, probable human carcinogen.",

Flush victim's eyes with water or normal saline solution for 20 to 30 minutes while simultaneously calling a hospital or poison control center. Do not put any ointments, oils, or medication in the victim's eyes without specific instructions from a physician. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim after flushing eyes to a hospital even if no symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop.  SKIN: IMMEDIATELY flood affected skin with water while removing and isolating all contaminated clothing. Gently wash all affected skin areas thoroughly with soap and water. IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center even if no symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital for treatment after washing the affected areas.  INHALATION: IMMEDIATELY leave the contaminated area; take deep breaths of fresh air. IMMEDIATELY call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital even if no symptoms (such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or burning in the mouth, throat, or chest) develop. Provide proper respiratory protection to rescuers entering an unknown atmosphere. Whenever possible, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) should be used; if not available, use a level of protection greater than or equal to that advised under Protective Clothing.  INGESTION: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. Phenols are very toxic poisons AND corrosive and irritating, so that inducing vomiting may make medical problems worse. IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center and locate activated charcoal, egg whites, or milk in case the medical advisor recommends administering one of them. If advice from a physician is not readily available and the victim is conscious and not convulsing, give the victim a glass of activated charcoal slurry in water or, if this is not available, a glass of milk, or beaten egg whites and IMMEDIATELY transport victim to a hospital. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, assure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital.  OTHER: Since this chemical is a known or suspected carcinogen you should contact a physician for advice regarding the possible long term health effects and potential recommendation for medical monitoring. Recommendations from the physician will depend upon the specific compound, its chemical, physical and toxicity properties, the exposure level, length of exposure, and the route of exposure.

It was found that adsorption on kaolinite was negligible, whereas bentone SD-3 presented an adsorption efficiency from 10 to 100 fold less than equivalent quantities of powdered activated carbon. The effect of the pH on the removal of pentachlorophenol by activated carbon was studied. The removal efficiency of pentachlorophenol by activated carbon is better in acidic media. A clear dependence of adsorption on the pH appeared to be the result of a marked variation on the pesticide solubility as a function of the pH. Adsorption of pentachlorophenol/phenate (5 mg/l) diminishes markedly at pH values above the pKa of this weak acid (equal to 5.9 : 0.1) when the pentachlorophenol exists almost entirely in ionic form in aqueous solution, and is enhanced at low pH when the percentage of molecular species (whose concentration can be determined from pKa value) becomes significant. These remarks and the adsorptive capacities (163 mg.g-1 = 0.6 mmol/g at pH = 5.2 and 79 mg/g = 0,3 mmol/g at pH = 12.7), suggest a negative interaction between pentachlorophenol and activated carbon which seems to be confirmed by the results with bentone SD-43 (tables 1 to 4), and the values of the electrokinetic potential of these materials. This study emphasizes the effect of organic coadsorbates (eg, dissolved humic substances and the pesticide lindane) on the adsorption capacity of activated carbon for pentachlorophenol. Two different natural organic matters were studied as coadsorbates: purified humic acids from a commercial source (at 10 mg/l) and fulvic acids extracted from a top soil horizon (at 20 mg/l). Pentachlorophenol absorption was not affected by humic acids, whereas an increase of adsorption seemed to be observed in the presence of fulvic acids. Pentachlorophenol does not affect the adsorption of the humic acids, but improves slightly the removal of fulvic acids. This suggests an association between the two kinds of organic compounds, the resulting complex, fulvic acids/pentachlorophenol, being more adsorbed than the compounds themselves. The coadsorbate lindane (0.65 mg/l) which is easily adsorbed by activated carbon seemed also to improve slightly the removal efficiency of pentachlorophenol by activated carbon.",

Moreover, groundwater pumped from a well depth of 21 m at a location adjacent to the site was heavily contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other organics. A study was conducted to determine the efficacy of ultrafiltration for removal of organics from groundwater at this USEPA, Super Fund site. Ultrafiltration reduced the concentration of total identified organics from 210.0 mg/l in groundwater to 1.5 mg/l in the post filtration permeate. Tests for toxicity/teratogenicity in embryonic inland silversides, Menidia beryllina; and Microtox 15 min EC50's were conducted with: (1) streamwater, (2) untreated groundwater, (3) feedwater used in the ultrafiltration system and (4) permeate water that passed through the ultrafiltration system. Concentration of 100% streamwater caused significant (alpha : 0.05) teratogenic responses in fish embryos and larvae; the Microtox EC50 was 3.7% streamwater. Groundwater and feedwater caused significant embryo toxic or teratogenic responses at concentrations of 100, 10, and 1%; the Microtox EC50's were 0.85 and 0.48%, respectively. In contrast, only 100% permeate water caused significant increases in terata, compared to the control response; at 10 and 1% concentration > 90% of hatched larvae appeared normal. The Microtox EC50 was 30% permeate water.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines newer health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether the use of the pesticide does not pose unreasonable risk in accordance to newer saftey standards, such as those described in the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List C, and with List C containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List D. Pentachlorophenol is found on List B. Case No: 2505; Pesticide type: insecticide, fungicide, antimicrobial; Case Status: OPP is reviewing data from the pesticide's producers regarding its human health and/or environmental effects, or OPP is determining the pesticide's eligibility for reregistration and developing the RED /Reregistration Eligibility Decision/ document.; Active ingredient (AI): Pentachlorophenol; Data Call-in (DCI) Date(s): 01/06/92, 08/04/88, 05/30/86; AI Status: The producers of the pesticide have made commitments to conduct the studies and pay the fees required for reregistration, and are meeting those commitments in a timely manner.",

In addition, a high incidence of two uncommon tumors (adrenal medulla pheochromocytomas and hemangiomas/hemangiosarcomas) was observed with both preparations.

Both chemicals revealed lethal and sub-lethal effects, such as no blood flow, cardiac edema, delayed hatching, and tail malformations. According to their median effective concentrations (EC(50) values) in the single exposure, the toxic level of PCP was about two orders of magnitude higher than that of BPA. Result of the joint action modes varied depending on different endpoints. Synergistic action was observed based on the endpoint of 24 hr mortality and antagonistic effect displayed based on the endpoint of 72 hr cardiac edema. It was also found that the toxicity of PCP would be enhanced with the addition of BPA even below its no observed effect concentration (NOEC) level at the endpoint of 32 hr with no blood flow, and the level of the increase was influenced by the toxic unit (TU) ratio.",

There is no specific antidote to the poisoning; therefore treatment is supportive in nature including oxygen, fluid replacement, and most importantly, fever control. Reduce elevated body temperature by physical means. Administer sponge baths and use fans to increase evaporation. In fully conscious patients, administer cold, sugar-containing liquids by mouth as tolerated. Cooling blankets and ice packs to body surfaces may also be used. Antipyretic therapy with salicylates is strongly contraindicated as salicylates also uncouple oxidative phosphorylation. Other antipyretics are thought to be of no use because of the peripherally mediated mechanism of hyperthermia in poisoning of this nature. Neither the safety nor the effectiveness of the other antipyretics has been tested. Administer oxygen continuously by mask to minimize tissue anoxia. Unless there are manifestations of cerebral or pulmonary edema or of inadequate renal function, administer intravenous fluids to restore hydration and support physiologic mechanisms for heat loss and toxicant disposition. Monitor serum electrolytes, adjusting IV infusions to stabilize electrolyte concentrations. Follow urine contents of albumin and cells, and keep an accurate hourly record of intake/output to forestall fluid overload if renal function declines. Caution: In the presence of cerebral edema and/or impaired renal function, intravenous fluids must be administered very cautiously to avoid increased intracranial pressure and pulmonary edema. Central monitoring of venous and pulmonary wedge pressures may be indicated. Such critically ill patients should be treated in an intensive care unit.",

Exposure to these pesticides should be ruled out when evaluating urinary levels. Reference Ranges: Normal - Average concentration approximately 0.063 mg/L, but has been found to be up to 0.100 mg/L in people with no recognized exposure to pentachlorophenol; Exposed - BEI (sampling time is prior to the last shift of workweek, measured as total pentachlorophenol): 2 mg/g creatinine. Pentachlorophenol concentrations in urine that have been found to correlate with workplace air concentrations are as follows: pentachlorophenol air levels of 0.05 and 0.10 mg/cu m correlate to urine pentachlorophenol levels (sampling time not fixed) of 300 and 600 ug/L, respectively; Toxic - Not established.",

Measurement of retinal binding protein appears to be a better marker for early tubular dysfunction due to its stability in the urine subsequent to collection and analysis.

The alpha isoenzyme is located only in the proximal tubule, while the pi isoenzyme is located in the distal convoluted tubule, the loop of Henle, and the collecting ducts of the kidney. Damage to epithelial cell membranes can result in the increased excretion of these isoenzymes in the urine. This test for assessing renal tubular damage appears to have many advantages over other available tests, such as: (1) the alpha and pi isoenzymes are constitutive proteins in the kidney; (2) these isoenzymes are stable in the urine, (3) the test is simple and reproducible; and (4) due to selective localization of the isoenzymes, differential diagnosis of specific tubular damage is possible. In addition, increased levels of these isoenzymes were seen in patients previously exposed to nephrotoxicants where conventional tests for kidney function were normal, indicating a high degree of sensitivity.",

Signs of acute toxicity included ataxia developing about 15 min after dosing, followed by rapidly developing motor weakness, hyperpyrexia, and rapid breathing about 25 min after dosing. Most deaths occurred either between 20 min and 2 hr, or between 4 hr and 8 hr following dosing. Those animals who recovered had little salivation, rectal temperatures only 1 to 3 °F above normal, and began to recover after 8 hr. Rats who were 10 to 20 days of age and not yet weaned and adult rats aged 70 to 134 days old formed the two most susceptible groups, far more susceptible than were juveniles aged 25 to 50 days, to the toxic effects of pentachlorophenol. The LD50 increased 4.4 times from postnatal day ten to postnatal day 25, plateaued from day 25 to 50, and decreased 2.8 times from day 50 to 134. The LD50 (mg/kg) ranged from 50 to 180 for preweaned rats, from 220 to 230 for juveniles (25-59 days old), and from 80 to 120 for adults (70-130 days old). The physiological reasons for the developmental susceptibility as evidenced in this study were not known.",

The chemicals responsible are presumably ingested when the bats groom their fur after they have been in contact with the treated timber. Bats prevented from establishing such bodily contact took longer to die indicating that absorption of the vapor phase of the tested chemicals also takes place across the skin or respiratory epithelium. Acrylic resin reduces the lethal effect when used as a sealant over wood treated with gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane and pentachlorophenol, but polyurethane varnish does not.",

Generally, reproductive and juvenile stages are the most sensitive, with LC50 values as low as 0.01 mg/L for fish larvae. Low levels of dissolved oxygen, low pH, and high temperature increase the toxic effects of PCP. Concentrations causing sublethal effects on fish are in the low g/L range. As PCP contamination in many surface waters is in this range, population and community effects cannot be ruled out. This is also indicated by the substantial alterations in the community structure of model ecosystems that are induced by PCP. PCP is accumulated by aquatic organisms. Fresh-water fish show bioconcentration factors of up to 1000 compared to <100 in marine fish. The portion of PCP taken up, either through the surrounding water or along the food chain, is probably species specific.",

                          "String": "Pentachlorophenol's production may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams; its use as a wood preservative and surface disinfectant will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.1X10-4 mm Hg at 20 °C indicates pentachlorophenol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase pentachlorophenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 29 days. The chemical behavior of pentachlorophenol will depend on whether it exists primarily as the phenol under acidic conditions or the phenolate anion, under basic conditions. Pentachlorophenol has a pH-dependent absorption max of 303 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, pentachlorophenol is expected to have low to no mobility based upon measured Koc values ranging from 1250 for the dissociated form to 25,000 for the undissociated form. The pKa of pentachlorophenol is 4.70, indicating that this compound will almost entirely exist in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the acid exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. As much as 55% of added pentachlorophenol was photodegraded in a sandy clay loam soil in 14 days, suggesting the photolysis of the dissociated form may be an important terrestrial fate process. Pentachlorophenol may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Screening biodegradability tests give conflicting results; pentachlorophenol does biodegrade but may require several weeks for acclimation. If released into water, pentachlorophenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon its measured Koc values. The pKa indicates pentachlorophenol will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. BCF values from approximately 5 to 5000 indicate that bioconcentration of pentachlorophenol in aquatic organisms is low to high, with the value being greatly influenced by environmental pH. Bioconcentration is expected to be pH dependent with greater accumulation at lower pH values. Pentachlorophenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Pentachlorophenol has a pH-dependent absorption max of 303 nm and will photodegrade rapidly in surface water when exposed to direct sun light with a measured half-life of 0.86 hrs reported. Occupational exposure to pentachlorophenol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where pentachlorophenol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to pentachlorophenol via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound. Once used in tremendous volumes as an insecticide and fungicide in preserving wood products, pentachlorophenol is being phased out as polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans have been found to be impurities associated with the manufacturing process as well as the sensitive detection methods that have been applied.

The pKa of pentachlorophenol is 4.70(3), indicating that this compound will almost entirely exist in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the acid exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Pentachlorophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 1.1X10-4 mm Hg at 25 °C(5). As much as 55% of added pentachlorophenol was photodegraded in a sandy clay loam soil in 14 days(6), suggesting the photolysis of the dissociated form may be an important terrestrial fate process(SRC).

Replicate streams were dosed continuously at pentachlorophenol concns of 0, 48, and 144 ug/L, respectively, for an 88 day period during the summer of 1983. Pentachlorophenol was degraded both aerobically and anaerobically. Aerobic degradation was more rapid than anaerobic degradation. Mineralization of pentachlorophenol was concommitant with pentachlorophenol disappearance under aerobic conditions, but lagged behind loss of the parent molecule under anaerobic conditions. Biodegradation in the streams, or in specific stream compartments such as the sediment or water column, was characterized by an adaptation period (3-5 weeks for the stream as a whole, and reproducible from the previous year), which was inversely dependent on the concn of pentachlorophenol and microbial biomass. The adaptation in the streams could be attributed to the time necessary for selective enrichment of an initially low population of pentachlorophenol degraders on surface compartments. The extent of biodegradation in the streams (percent loss of initial concn of pentachlorophenol) increased with increasing pentachlorophenol input, which was explicable by an increase in the pentachlorophenol degrader population with increasing pentachlorophenol concn. The sediment zone most significant to overall pentachlorophenol biodegradation was the top 0.5 to 1 cm layer as shown by pentachlorophenol migration rates and depth profiles of degrader density within the sediment. Pentachlorophenol profiles in sediment cores taken during and after the adaptation period for degradation showed that diffusion of pentachlorophenol into the sediment was rate limiting to degradation in this compartment.",

Using an acclimated pentachlorophenol-degrading culture, half-lives of 85 (lag time of 27 hours) and 420 (lag time of 220 hours) hours were reported for aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively(8). Pentachlorophenol, present at 100 mg/L, reached 1% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(9). Acclimation of microbial communities to pentachlorophenol appears to increase tolerance to pentachlorophenol and/or select for pentachlorophenol-tolerant microorganisms(10). Pentachlorophenol, at an initial concn of 300-500 ug/L, had a half-life of 2.6 days using a sludge inoculum(11). At this concentration, no lag phase was seen(11).",

An avg first-order rate constant of 0.021 per hour was measured for pentachlorophenol at an initial concn of 10 ug/L in a SCAS test using domestic sewage with a sludge retention time of 10 days(1).

Pentachlorophenol, initially present at 890 ug/L, was found at 0.39 ug/L in the effluent of an activated sewage sludge treatment plant; dewatered sludge contained 0.16 mg/kg pentachlorophenol(2). 41 and 60% removal was reported for pentachlorophenol in a trickling filter system (49 ug/L in secondary sludge) and during activated sludge treatment (99 ug/L in secondary sludge), respectively(3). After 6 months of operation, a lab-scale fixed film reactor was able to remove about 60% of the initially added pentachlorophenol; if glucose was added then removal reached 98%(4). Biodegradation of pentachlorophenol stopped when the sludge retention time was <8 days(5). Laboratory scale activated sludge reactors run under continuous flow conditions gave minimum and max first-order rate constants for the removal of pentachlorophenol of 0-2 and 1-24 per g/MLSS/day(6).

A lag period of 11 days with complete degradation by day 17 was reported for the non-adapted culture; the lag period was 9 days with complete degradation by 13 days for the adapted culture(1). Intermediate products of 3,5-dichlorophenol, 3,4,5-trichlorophenol, 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenol were reported(1). Increasing the concn of pentachlorophenol, from 1 to 10 mg/L, increased the time required for complete biodegradation. Complete biodegradation at pH 7 and 8 required 13 and 3 days, respectively; only 20% biodegradation was reported by day 19 for cultures incubated at pH 6(1). Anaerobic biodegradation of a pentachlorophenol-contaminated soil resulted in an initial increase in pentachlorophenol concns due to desorption; this was followed by a period of dechlorination giving 2,3,4,5- and 2,3,5,6-tetrachlorophenol as initial metabolites(2). No biodegradation occurred in anaerobic clay loam soil with no added nutrients(3). Other studies in soil have suggested greater biodegradation under anaerobic conditions producing pentachloroanisole and tri- and tetrachlorophenols(4,5). The order of pentachlorophenol dechlorination in anaerobic sediment is ortho to produce 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenol, ortho to produce 3,4,5-trichlorophenol, meta to produce 2,4-dichlorophenol, and para or ortho to produce 2-chlorophenol or 4-chlorophenol(6).",

A measured half-life for the photolysis of pentachlorophenol in solution has been reported to be 0.86 hrs(7). In water at pH 7.3, 90% degradation occurred in 10 hr with sunlight while at pH 3 (mostly undissociated form), 40% degradation occurred in 90 hr(2). Reported half-lives for photodegradation of the dissociated form have included 0.2 hr (10 cm deep)(1), 3.5 hr(2), 4.75 hr (300 cm deep)(1), and 10 days(3). Products of photodegradation include 2,3-dichloromaleic acid, 2,3,5,6- and 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol, tetrachlororesorcinol, tetrachlorocatechol(4), benzoquinones(2,3), and possibly dioxins(5). Photolysis in a solution of H2O-CH3CN using 290 nm wavelengths and a pH of 12 produces the photoproduct 2-methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrachlorobenazole(6). Half-lives of 24 minutes, 30.9 minutes, and 635 minutes were reported for aqueous solutions of pentachlorophenol under direct sunlight, under a clear plastic sheet, and under a black plastic sheet, respectively(9). As much as 55% of added pentachlorophenol was photodegraded in a sandy clay loam soil in 14 days with conditions present to increase rates of evaporative flux(9). Little loss of pentachlorophenol was noted in dry soils or soils covered with black plastic. Photodegradation rates are lower than aqueous rates due to the attenuation of light by natural chromophores(9). A second-order rate constant of 9.36X10+7 per M-sec was reported for the reaction of pentachlorophenol with singlet oxygen(10).",

                          "String": "Koc values for pentachlorophenol of 2285 (pH 4.9), 4267 (pH 5.0), 6224 (pH 5.9), 3684 (pH 4.6), 121681 (pH 3.5), 121810 (pH 3.9), 97471 (pH 3.7), 1586 (pH 5.0), 4109 (pH 5.1), 4009 (pH 5.5), 123563 (pH 3.5) have been reported(1). According to a classification scheme(2), these Koc values indicate that pentachlorophenol is expected to have slight to no mobility in soil(SRC). Freundlich isotherm coefficients were determined to be 5 (silty sand soil), 5 (aquifer), and 3 (marine sediment)(9). A log Koc of 3.16 was observed in sediment of the Yangtse River in China(10). Since pentachlorophenol has a pKa of 4.70(3), its adsorptivity will be strongly dependent on pH. The Freundlich adsorption constant for 6 Dutch soils are (soil (% organic carbon, pH) log KF, 1/N): humic sand (1.7%, 3.4) 2.2, 0.9; humic sand (2.2%, 4.9) 2.2, 0.9; humic-rich sand (3.2%, 4.7) 2.6, 1.0; peat (29.8%, 4.6) 3.3, 0.8; light loam (0.9%, 7.5) 1.1, 0.9; heavy loam (1.7%, 7.1) 1.5, 0.8(4). For loam soil where pH >pKa, significant contribution from the phenolate ion can be expected. The Koc values for the total dissociated phenol was calculated to be 1250 and 1800 for light and heavy loam, respectively, while for the undissociated species, the Koc is 25,000(5). The fraction of pentachlorophenol which is sorbed decreases linearly with pH to a pH 6; above pH 6, significant adsorption of the anion again occurs, contributing as much as 20% of the total adsorption effect at pH 8(4). K values for a Bjuv clay (organic carbon 12%) and an aquifer soil (organic carbon 0.02%) were 433 and 86 at pH 3.0, respectively, and 167 and 50 at pH 6.5, respectively(4). K values for a bentonite clay of 72 and 34 were measured at pH 3.0 and 6.5, respectively(4). The nonionized form of pentachlorophenol had a K value of 3.63 mL/g in a sandy aquifer material (organic C 0.13%) (Koc 2792)(6). K values measured at pH 7 for a Guishan sandy loam (organic carbon 1.4%) and a Shulin clay loam (organic carbon 2.0%) were 2.56 (Koc 183) and 7.03 (Koc 352), respectively(7). The Koc for pentachlorophenol was measured for five soils (foc from 0.07 to 2.96%; 3 sands, 1 loamy sand, 1 loam)(8). At pH 4, 7, and 10, the Koc values ranged from 10091-40120 (avg 19675), 178-1956 (avg 651), and 126-942 (avg 501), respectively(8).",

This agrees with a field study in an artificial stream in which <0.006% of the added pentachlorophenol was lost by volatilization(2). The chemical behavior of pentachlorophenol will depend on whether it exists primarily as the phenol under acidic conditions or the phenolate anion, under basic conditions(3) and also temperature(4); at pH 5, the half-life from water surfaces is 328 hours (30 °C) while at pH 6, the half-life is 3120 hours(4). Also reported was a 25-51% of added pesticide-formulated pentachlorophenol detected in the air in terrestrial microcosms(5,6,7). Pentachlorophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure of 1.1X10-4 mm Hg(8).",

Pentachlorophenol was detected in groundwater in a monitoring program in California, Oregon and Minnesota(2). In Minnesota, 3% of wells monitored by the Agriculture Department had detectable pentachlorophenol with a max level of 0.64 ppb. In Oregon, 1.4% of tested wells contained pentachlorophenol and the max concn was 0.12 ppb(2). Concns of pentachlorophenol in groundwater were 1047 and 152 ppb at Havertown pentachlorophenol site, Havertown, PA(3) and Doepke disposal site, Holliday, KS, respectively(4). The leaking of pentachlorophenol from a sawmill dip tank in British Columbia resulted in the contamination of a shallow aquifer at peak concns of 20 to 63 mg/L; the nearby Okanagan River received contaminated groundwater with a travel time of 47 days (for 122 m distance)(5). Groundwater from Visalia, CA was heavily contaminated with pentachlorophenol(6). At the Pensacola site, a former wood treatment plant in Florida resulted in the contamination of an underlying aquifer with pentachlorophenol at concns from 0.0 to 3.53 mg/L(6). Pentachlorophenol was detected at a max concn of 40 ug/L in the Biscayne aquifer study area(7). Pentachlorophenol was detected in one groundwater supply site in Atlantic Canada at 11 ug/L(8). Groundwater was contaminated with pentachlorophenol (maximum concn = 0.01% solution) from a wood treatment facility in Florence, SC(9).",

In a pilot EPA study of non-occupational exposure to pesticides, nine households in an urban-suburban area of Jacksonville, FL, an area of high pesticide use, were monitored(2). Pentachlorophenol was detected indoors in two households and outdoors in one household(2).

The study group consisted of 35 persons exposed to pentachlorophenol in six workplaces and 123 persons living in 45 homes constructed of pentachlorophenol treated logs. The comparisons consisted of 143 persons living in conventional homes and not occupationally exposed to pentachlorophenol. Urine and blood samples were collected and analyzed for pentachlorophenol. Among the comparisons, urine pentachlorophenol concentrations ranged from 1 to 17 ppb, mean 3.4 ppb. Serum samples from 34 comparisons ranged from 15 to 75 ppb, mean 40 ppb. In persons living in pentachlorophenol treated log homes, serum pentachlorophenol concentrations ranged from 69 to 1340 ppb, mean 420 ppb. The serum pentachlorophenol concns decreased with increasing age. Subjects in the 2 to 7 year old group had significantly higher serum pentachlorophenol concns than those over 15 years old. The serum pentachlorophenol concentrations in children 2 to 15 years old averaged 1.7 to 2.0 times that of their parents. Repeat blood samples taken from ten persons residing in homes in which the logs were coated with a sealant showed that sealing the logs resulted in decreased serum pentachlorophenol concentrations. Urine pentachlorophenol concns ranged from 1 to 340 ppb, mean 69 ppb. When the urine pentachlorophenol concns were corrected for creatinine concns, they correlated well with the serum pentachlorophenol concns. Serum pentachlorophenol concentrations in the pentachlorophenol workers ranged from 26 to 84900 ppb. The lowest concentrations occurred in workers constructing homes from pentachlorophenol treated logs and the highest in workers exposed to pentachlorophenol in chemical factories. Urine pentachlorophenol concentrations in four workers ranged from 2400 to 13800 ppb, mean 10000 ppb(1).",
