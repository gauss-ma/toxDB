The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

The plasma concentration-time profile for chlorobenzene on cessation of exposure, as estimated by respiratory elimination of radioactivity, indicated a two compartment elimination. Increase in exposure by a factor of seven (100-700 ppm) increased the total uptake of radioactivity by a factor of about 13. This increase in body burden was associated with a decrease in total body clearance, as indicated by an approximate four fold increase in the half-life of the central compartment. The proportion of the dose excreted via the lungs (which may be presumed to be largely, if not entirely, unchanged chlorobenzene) increased nonlinearly and the proportion eliminated by hepatic metabolism decreased. Increase in the dose of chlorobenzene was associated with a decrease in the proportion cleared as the mercapturic acid derivative. Of interest, the half-life of chlorobenzene was shorter at the 700 ppm exposure level when the animals were subjected to repeated treatment daily for 5 days, as compared with that of the single 700 ppm exposure animals, raising the possibility of induction of metabolic clearance. In agreement with this possibility, the proportion cleared by metabolism in the multi-exposed animals was increased, and the proportion excreted unchanged via the lung was decreased, as compared with the 700 ppm-single exposure animals.",

MCB and 1,2-DCB were oxidized mainly by rat and human CYP2E1. It was found that 1,4-DCB was oxidized by rat and human CYP2E1 at a several-fold lower rate than 1,2-DCB, but a greater part to covalently binding products. In contrast to previous studies showing rat CYP3A1 as the main CYP form oxidising both DCBs, our experiments indicate only a certain role of rat and human CYP3A in MCB, 1,2-DCB and 1,4-DCB oxidation to covalently bound products. The relative roles of human liver CYP2E1 and 3A4 in the metabolism of 1,4-DCB seem to be individually different. Metabolic rates of MCB, 1,2-DCB and 1,4-DCB correlated with CYP2E1 immunochemical level in microsomes from 11 different human livers and with metabolic rates of CYP2E1 substrates. These rates in different human livers were up to 10-fold different and were generally several-fold higher than those in untreated rats or mice. Metabolic activation of MCB and 1,2-DCB to products binding covalently to microsomal proteins and to calf-thymus DNA, respectively, mostly corresponded to production of water-soluble metabolites. Significant species and sex differences in the oxidation of MCB, 1,2-DCB and 1,4-DCB were reflected in a markedly higher oxidation in male mice than male rats and higher oxidation in male than female mice. The formation of covalently bound products generally corresponded to production of soluble metabolites, but female rats formed significantly less covalently bound products of 1,4-DCB (and also of 1,2-DCB and MCB) than male rats and mice of both sexes ...",

As shown by whole-body autoradiograms, with heated tissue section, a selective localization of non-volatile metabolites occurred in the mucosa of the entire respiratory system. Microautoradiograms showed that tissue bound metabolites were present in the epithelium of the nasal and tracheobronchial mucosa and in subepithelial glands in the olfactory nasal mucosa. In vitro experiments with slices from the nasal mucosa, lung, and liver indicated transformation of chlorobenzene to metabolites which could not be extracted from the tissues; the binding was most pronounced in the nasal mucosa. The formation of nonextractable metabolites by the nasal mucosa and lung in vitro was decreased by metyrapone, piperonyl butoxide, and SKF 525, indicating a cytochrome p450 dependent metabolism of (14)C-chlorobenzene in the respiratory tissues. Autoradiography of lung slices incubated with (14)C-chlorobenzene revealed that a preferential localization of metabolites in the bronchial mucosa also occurred in vitro. ... The binding of metabolites in the nasal mucosa suggest that this tissue may also be a site of toxic action of chlorobenzene.",

The study group included 44 clinically healthy men from the facility ranging in age from 21 to 49 years. They were monitored during several shifts of the 24 day period required to perform the maintenance activities; 251 whole shift personal air sampling measurements were performed. All time weighted average exposure values of MCB were below the maximum concentration value in the work place that is currently recommended, 50 ppm. A urine sample was also collected which revealed that 4-chlorophenol and 4-chlorocatechol could be detected at exposure levels of MCB below the allowable limits. The production of 4-chlorocatechol was generally three times higher than that of 4-chlorophenol. A statistically significant correlation existed between the MCB time weighted average concentration and the concentration of each metabolite in the urine collected at the end of the workshift. /Results suggest/ caution that biological limit values should be considered as tentative since the metabolite concentration in urine were only characterized for MCB levels below 50 ppm.",

Twenty-four hour urine samples were collected over a period of 7 days. p-Chlorophenylmercapturic acid, chlorophenols and a guanine adduct was determined by chromatographic methods. The excretion pattern of p-chlorophenyl-mercapturic acid did not seem to be significantly affected by phenobarbital. To analyze for the chlorophenols and guanine adducts, diluted urine was subjected to cation exchange chromotography using UV-detection. Fractions were found containing chlorophenols and a compound showing chromatographic properties similar to those of the synthetic N7-phenylguanine. The results of the HPLC analyses suggested the presence of a guanine adduct excreted on days 1 and 2 and between days 4 and 6 post-administration. There were no compounds detected which were identical with p-, m- or o-isomers of N7-chlorophenylguanine. The excretion of p- and m-chlorophenols by phenobarbital-pretreated animals was twice as high as that in untreated rats. A 4-fold increase was detected for o-chlorophenol. It is assumed that it is mainly direct hydroxylation that can be induced by phenobarbital. Dehalogenated phenolic metabolites may be capable of covalent binding to DNA.",

Occupational studies have shown that acute and chronic exposure to chlorobenzene can cause irritation of the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and eyes. Using in vitro assays, /it was/ shown in a previous study that human bronchial epithelial cells release inflammatory mediators such as the cytokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in response to chlorobenzene. This response is mediated through the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Here, /researchers/ investigated the effects of monochlorobenzene on human lung cells, with emphasis on potential alterations of the redox equilibrium to clarify whether the chlorobenzene-induced inflammatory response in lung epithelial cells is caused via an oxidative stress-dependent mechanism. /It was/ found that expression of cellular markers for oxidative stress, such as heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), glutathione S-transferase pi1 (GSTP1), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) and dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), were elevated in the presence of monochlorobenzene. Likewise, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were increased in response to exposure. However, in the presence of the antioxidants N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine (MPG) or bucillamine, chlorobenzene-induced upregulation of marker proteins and release of the inflammatory mediator MCP-1 are suppressed. These results complement /the authors/ previous findings and point to an oxidative stress-mediated inflammatory response following chlorobenzene exposure.",

To characterize the underlying mechanisms ... the influence of chlorobenzene on the activation of two intracellular signalling pathways: the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways /were investigated/. Human lung epithelial cells (A549) were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in the presence or absence of specific inhibitors of NF-kappaB or the p38 MAP kinase and exposed to chlorobenzene using an air-liquid cell culture system. Exposure of lung epithelial cells to chlorobenzene resulted in an activation of NF-kappa B and p38 MAP kinase and a release of the chemokine MCP-1. In the presence of IKK-NBD, a specific NF-kappa B inhibitor, or the inhibitors of the p38 MAP kinase SB 203580 and SB 202190, the chlorobenzene-related MCP-1 release was suppressed, suggesting an involvement of both pathways in the chlorobenzene induced expression of MCP-1. /These/ data show that the release of MCP-1 following chlorobenzene exposure is dependent on the NF-kappa B and MAPK pathways.",

The extent of in vivo enzymatic activation of brominated compounds was higher than that of chlorinated chemicals. Aryl halides were bound mainly to liver DNA whereas interaction of alkyl halides with DNA of liver, kidney, and lung gave rise to similar binding extent. In vitro activation of all chemicals was mediated by microsomal p450-dependent mixed function oxidase system present in rat and mouse liver and, in smaller amount, in mouse lung. Activation of alkyl halides by liver cytosolic GSH-trasferases even occurred. The relative reactivity of chemicals in vivo, expressed as covalent binding index to rat liver DNA, was: 1,2-dibromoethane > bromobenzene > 1,2-dichloroethane > chlorobenzene > epichlorohydrin > benzene. On the whole, it agreed with in vitro activation of chemicals, with genotoxicity data from other short-term assays ... . Covalent binding index values of chlorobenzene and bromobenzene gave the first clear evidence of genotoxicity and of possible carcinogenicity of these two chemicals.",

A microsome-mediated interaction with DNA occurred in vitro. The interaction was enhanced by pretreatment in vivo with phenobarbitone but was suppressed by addition of 2-diethylaminoethyl-2,2-diphenylvalerate hydrochloric acid in vitro. These results indicate the involvement of cytochrome p450. Liver microsomes were efficient bioactivators, whereas cytosol was ineffective. The extent of in vitro interaction of chlorobenzene with synthetic polyribonucleotides was of the same order as that with DNA. Finally, ultraviolet irradiation (lambda= 254 nm or lambda max= 365 nm) activated this environmental contaminant to forms capable of interacting with DNA.",

ATR-FTIR spectra revealed that amide groups and PO(2)(-) of the phospholipid phospho-diester, both in the hydrophobic end exposed to the outer layer, were the easiest to be damaged. The relationship between IC(50) and chemicals structure parameters ..., indicated that the more chlorine atoms were substituted, the greater the toxicity was.

                      "String": "IDENTIFICATION: Chlorobenzene, in its pure form, is a colorless liquid that has an almond-like odor. It is volatile and flammable. Chlorobenzene dissolves moderately in water. Chloroenzene may occur in the environment from biodegradation of other chlorine compounds. Chlorobenzene was identified in volcano gases. It can be formed in nature during the formation of meteorites. USE: Chlorobenzene is used as a solvent for some pesticide formulations, as a degreaser, and to make other chemicals. EXPOSURE: Chlorobenzene is not a widespread environmental pollutant as in the past. Humans may be exposed to chlorobenzene by inhaling contaminated air, drinking water or eating food contaminated with chlorobenzene or by getting contaminated soil on your skin. These exposures are most likely to occur at workplaces making chlorobenzene or near chemical wastes sites. Occupational exposure is most likely by inhalation. Exposure could occur in people living or working near a hazardous waste site if emissions to water, air, or soil are not controlled very well. In air, chlorobenzene can be transported away from the source of contamination. Chlorobenzene in air is degraded by light with a half-life of 20 to 40 hours. Chlorobenzene absorbs to soil and is biodegraded rapidly. In water, it breaks down more slowly and can also evaporate. Chlorobenzene has been found in samples of surface waters and ground waters. RISK: Workers exposed to high levels of chlorobenzene in air have reported headaches, numbness, sleepiness, nausea and vomiting. Restlessness, tremors, unconsciousness and death have been observed at very high levels in animal studies. Animal studies have also shown that chlorobenzene can cause severe injury to the liver and kidneys. Chlorobenzene does not cause birth defects or affect the reproductive system. Studies in animals have shown that chlorobenzene can produce liver nodules, providing some but not clear evidence of cancer risk. (SRC)",

Flush victim's eyes with water or normal saline solution for 20 to 30 minutes while simultaneously calling a hospital or poison control center. Do not put any ointments, oils, or medication in the victim's eyes without specific instructions from a physician. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim after flushing eyes to a hospital even if no symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop.  SKIN: IMMEDIATELY flood affected skin with water while removing and isolating all contaminated clothing. Gently wash all affected skin areas thoroughly with soap and water. IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center even if no symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital for treatment after washing the affected areas.  INHALATION: IMMEDIATELY leave the contaminated area; take deep breaths of fresh air. IMMEDIATELY call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital even if no symptoms (such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or burning in the mouth, throat, or chest) develop. Provide proper respiratory protection to rescuers entering an unknown atmosphere. Whenever possible, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) should be used; if not available, use a level of protection greater than or equal to that advised under Protective Clothing.  INGESTION: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. If the victim is conscious and not convulsing, give 1 or 2 glasses of water to dilute the chemical and IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center. Be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital if advised by a physician. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, ensure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital.

FIRE INVOLVING TANKS OR CAR/TRAILER LOADS: Fight fire from maximum distance or use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles. Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire. For massive fire, use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2016)",

The product was collected in a trap cooled with liquid nitrogen and analyzed by gas/liquid chromatography. Model runs were also undertaken with chlorobenzene, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, and biphenyl at temperatures decreasing over a series of four runs from 875 degrees to 750. Conversions of PCBs were approximately 10, 28, 70, and greater than 99.9% after runs one through four, respectively. Dichlorobenzene and trichlorobenzene accounted for approximately 6% of the Aroclor feed. Chlorobenzene and biphenyl were also products, although the determination of chlorobenzene was obscured by its use as diluent. Methane and small amounts of ethylene, ethane, ethane, and traces of ethyne were also formed. In model runs with chlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene, and biphenyl the amount of biphenyl left was only 0.75%. Dechlorination was again approximately 95%, leaving only traces of 1,2,4-trichlorophenyl. Increasing temperature to 925 degrees increased dechlorination to 99.95%.",

Prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas. A vapor-suppressing foam may be used to reduce vapors.

After 20 hr of exposure cytotoxicity and the release of the pro-inflammatory molecules monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 was analyzed. Exposure of A549 cells to chlorobenzene, styrene or m-xylene increased the MCP-1 production within the indoor relevant concentration range (1-25,000 microg/cu m), higher concentrations increased the secretion of IL-8. Mixtures of aromatic compounds caused comparable effects to the single compounds on MCP-1 and IL-8 with a shift to lower concentration ranges. Neither the aliphatic compounds n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and methylcyclopentane nor the mixture of these VOC showed any effects on MCP-1 and IL-8 production. Cytotoxic effects were not observed. These results show that aromatic, but no aliphatic compounds stimulate the release of pro-inflammatory mediators from lung epithelial cells. When aromatic compounds were mixed the sensitivity of lung cells to these compounds was increased.",

Pretreatment with either toxicant alone, or in combination, elevated the metabolism of 1.12 g/kg chlorobenzene to conjugated and polar metabolites. The relative importance of these pathways was increased most by pretreatment with chlorobenzene plus lindane and least with chlorobenzene /alone/. The incidence and severity of chlorobenzene induced hepatocellular necrosis depended on how much the pretreatments increased excretion of these metabolites relative to that of p-chlorophenol, since the conjugates and polar metabolites represent an inactivation of the toxic chlorobenzene-3,4-epoxide, whereas, p-chlorophenol reflects its formation. Thus these changes in the metabolic pathways resulted in either (1) a marginally significant decrease in hepatoxicity (chlorobenzene pretreatment); (2) significance in both the incidence and severity of the lesions (lindane pretreatment) or (3) absence of centrilobular necrosis was present (chlorobenzene and lindane pretreatment). Apparently the effect of pretreatment with xenobiotics on chlorobenzene induced hepatotoxicity was dependent on how much the pretreatments altered the inactivation of chlorobenzene-3,4-epoxide relative to its formation.",

Male Wistar rats were injected ip with 2 mmol/kg bromobenzene, 4 mmol/kg toluene, or 4 mmol/kg chlorobenzene either alone or in combination. Rats were killed 12, 24, or 48 hr after injection and liver injury was assessed biochemically and histopathologically. Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase and liver glutathione were measured. In vitro experiments were performed on liver microsomes from male Wistar rats pretreated with phenobarbital. Toluene and chlorobenzene each inhibited bromobenzene hepatotoxicity as measured by suppression of glutamate pyruvate transaminase concentrations and by histopathology at 24 hr after treatment; chlorobenzene significantly decreased at 12 hr and recovered at 24 hours when bromobenzene was given alone. This recovery at 24 hr disappeared when chlorobenzene was coadministered. Kinetic analysis of rat liver microsomes of bromobenzene metabolism showed that both toluene and chlorobenzene at 6 mmol/L inhibited p-bromophenol formation but had no effects on o-bromophenol formation.",

                          "String": "IDENTIFICATION AND USE: Chlorobenzene is a colorless liquid with a characteristic penetrating, almond-like odor.  It is used as an Intermediate in the manufacture of chloronitrobenzenes, oxide, DDT, and silicones; as a process solvent for methylene diisocyanate, adhesives, polishes, waxes, pharmaceutical products, paints, and natural rubber; as a degrading solvent; heat transfer medium; in textile processing; and tar and grease remover.  HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY:  Dermal exposure to chlorobenzene for 1 hour resulted in burning pain, hyperemia, whealing, and erythema formation at the application site.  Twelve hours postexposure, a minimal local vesiculation was seen.  Continuous contact for a week may result in moderate erythema and slight superficial necrosis.  Clinical symptoms included hyperpnea, ataxia, labored breathing, prostration, and death from respiratory paralysis.  Humans occupationally exposed to chlorobenzene intermittently for up to 2 years at levels above current federal limits displayed signs of neurotoxicity including numbness, cyanosis (from depression of respiratory center), hyperesthesia, and muscle spasms.  Early complaints included headache and irritation of the upper respiratory tract and mucosa of the eyes.  Clinical examination of workers exposed to chlorobenzene in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride showed that some workers reported nerve lesions, hepatitis, chronic gastritis with gastric juice hypoacidity, and bronchitis.  Severe anemia and medullary aplasia in a 70 year old woman was related to her employment in hat making, which required the use of glue containing 70% chlorobenzene.  A 2 year old boy swallowed 5 to 10 mL of Puran, a cleaning agent containing chlorobenzene and 2.5 hr after ingestion, lost consciousness and suffered vascular paralysis and heart failure.  He survived, and the odor of chlorobenzene was present in breath and urine for 5 to 6 days.  ANIMAL STUDIES:  Chlorobenzene is lethal following acute, intermediate, and chronic oral exposures in animals. Neurological effects of chlorobenzene have also been reported in animals following inhalation. Acute inhalation exposure produced muscle spasms followed by /CNS depression/ in rabbits exposed to 5 mg/L chlorobenzene (1,090 ppm) or greater for 2 hours.  Dermal contact resulted in moderate skin and eye irritant (tested in the guinea pig and rabbit, respectively).  Single ip injections of chlorobenzene in rats resulted in time- and dose-dependent hepatotoxicity, including liver necrosis, increased liver weights, and increased serum enzyme activities with dose-dependent recovery.  Systemic effects of single ip injections of chlorobenzene also included damage to the kidney, effects on bile and pancreatic flow, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and centrilobular necrosis.  Death occurred within 2 to 3 days after a single exposure to 4,000 mg/kg in corn oil by gavage in rats of both sexes, and in mice after a single exposure to 1,000 mg/kg.  Administration of chlorobenzene by gavage resulted in dose-dependent chemical induced injuries to the liver (centrilobular hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis), kidney (necrosis of the proximal tubular epithelium), bone marrow (myeloid depletion), spleen (lymphoid depletion or necrosis) and thymus at doses > or = 250 mg/kg.  Male and female mice exposed to chlorobenzene at 2500 mg/cu m daily, 7d/wk for 3 weeks showed loss of appetite, general emaciation, marked somnolence and weight loss; 5 animals died.  Autopsy revealed fatty degeneration in the liver, leading to acute yellow atrophy. The majority of mice showed a decrease in white blood cell number with relative decrease in neutrophils and relative increase in lympocytes.  Chronic exposure of mice to chlorobenzene at 100 mg/cu m daily for 3 months, showed increased agitation and motility and decreased white blood cell count with relative decrease in neutrophils and relative increase in lymphocytes.  In a two-generation study in rats, chlorobenzene in concentrations up to 450 ppm did not adversely affect reproductive performance or fertility. Chlorobenzene was not mutagenic for Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 or TA1538, with or without addition of rat liver or hamster liver homogenate.  Chlorobenzene did not induce DNA damage in Escherichia coli strains WP2 uvr A+ rec A+ or WP100 uvr A- rec A- or S. typhimurium strains TA1978 uvr B+ or TA1538 uvr B-.  Slight leukopenia and lymphocytosis occurred in mice exposed to chlorobenzene (0.1 mg/L) for 3 months. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Chlorobenzene was less hepatotoxic to trout than rats. This difference could not be totally accounted for by reduced absorption in trout. Chlorobenzenes caused significant increases in serum testosterone concentration in the crucian carps compared to the controls.",

Serum testosterone and 17 beta-estradiol concentrations were detected using radioimmunology assay (RIA), and the activities of two hepatic microsome enzymes, glutathione s-transferase (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT), were measured using the modified methods as described by Habig and Owens. Results showed that the four chlorobenzenes caused significant increases in serum testosterone concentration in the crucian carps (P < 0.05) compared to the controls, but they caused no significant effect on 17 beta-estradiol level. All test chemicals caused a change in hepatic GST activity in crucian carps, with significant increases in enzyme activity (P < 0.05). Chlorobenzene, 1,3-dichlorobenzene and p-chloro-methylbenzene resulted in a marked inhibition to UDPGT activity in crucian carp (P < 0.05) except 1,4-dichlorobenzene.

The organisms were exposed to chlorobenzene solutions for 48 hr to obtain effective concentration (EC50) values (in terms of percent DNA reduction). The toxicity (EC50) increased with increasing degree of chlorination, as follows: monochlorobenzene (235.74 mg/L), dichlorobenzenes (23.33-51.88 mg/L), trichlorobenzenes 0.59-6.42 mg/L), tetrachlorobenzenes (0.27-1.39 mg/L), pentachlorobenzene (0.008 mg/L) and hexachlorobenzene (0.002 mg/L). Quantitative structure-activity relationships were developed showing high correlations, as follows: water solubility (r2 = 0.96); molecular volume (r2 = 0.92); zero-order connectivity index (r2 = 0.92); second-order connectivity index (r2 = 0.02); molecular surface area (r2 = 0.92); octanol/water partition coefficients (r2 - 0.86); bioconcentration factor (r2 = 0.86); and inorganic/organic character (r2 = 0.83). A poor correlation, however, was obtained with the molecular negentropy index (r2 = 0.25). The toxic effect (EC50) was explained in terms of a partitioning process as a function of the aqueous solubility of the chlorobenzenes and was found to occur at similar degrees of exposure saturation.",

Data from analytical monitoring programs in large rivers and estuaries in the North Sea area were collected and evaluated for effects and environmental concentrations. Risk is indicated by the ratio of predicted environmental concentration (PEC) to predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) for the marine aquatic environment. In total, 27 data for fish, 24 data for invertebrates and 13 data for algae were evaluated. Acute and chronic toxicity studies were taken into account and appropriate assessment factors used to define a final PNEC value of 32 microg/L. Recent monitoring data indicate that monochlorobenzene levels in surface waters are below determination limits of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 ug/L used in monitoring programs. Assuming that half of the lowest determination (0.1 ug/L) is typical, a PEC of 0.05 ug/L was derived. A worst case of 0.5 ug/L is assumed. PEC/PNEC ratios give safety factors of 60 to over 500, taking no account of dilution in the sea. Monochlorobenzene is not a toxic, persistent and liable to bioaccumulate substance sensu the Oslo and Paris Conventions for the Prevention of Marine Pollution (OSPAR-DYNAMEC) criteria. Environmental fate and effects data indicate that current use of monochlorobenzene poses no unacceptable risk to the aquatic environment.",

Chlorobenzene has been identified as one of various halocarbons emitted in volcanic gases. It has been detected in flue gas emissions from municipal waste incinerators. Chlorobenzene can be formed in the environment through microbial degradation of higher chlorinated benzenes. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 12 mm Hg at 25 Â°C indicates chlorobenzene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase chlorobenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 21 hrs. Chlorobenzene absorbs light at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. Vapor-phase deposition of chlorobenzene from ambient air to snow and ice may occur through sorption. If released to soil, chlorobenzene is expected to have very high to moderate mobility based upon a Koc range of 4.8 to 313. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.11X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Chlorobenzene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data are conflicting. Chlorobenzene biodegrades slowly in soil and aquifer material. Biological screening tests have observed slow biodegradation, with degradation occurring more rapidly with acclimated microorganisms. If released into water, chlorobenzene may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.4 hours and 4.3 days, respectively. Reported BCF values of 3.9 to 450 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. In water, some biodegradation occurs, proceeding more rapidly in fresh water than in estuarine and marine waters. Occupational exposure to chlorobenzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where chlorobenzene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to chlorobenzene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal and inhalation contact with consumer products containing this compound.

The biodegradation half-life of chlorobenzene was reported to be 150 days in river water and 75 days in sediment(2). Chlorobenzene was generally not mineralized after 8 months incubation in soil(3). A half-life of 7 days was measured in soil-groundwater slurries using natural microbial consortia isolated from contaminated soils and groundwater(4). No degradation of chlorobenzene occurred over a period of 8 months in a laboratory study using subsurface soil samples from an uncontaminated environment(4). Chlorobenzene, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in four weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(5). 99.0% removal of chlorobenzene was observed in a pilot-scale activated sludge system, an estimated 82.8% was attributed to biodegradation, 1.5% was adsorbed, and 14.7% was stripped(6). Chlorobenzene achieved 15% degradation after a 28-day incubation period using an activated sludge inoculum and a modified MITI test protocol(7). Using OECD 301B (Modified Sturm Test - CO2 Evolution) with an adapted activated sludge inoculum, only 10% theoretical CO2 evolved after 63 days(7). Greater than 90% degradation of chlorobenzene occurred after 15 days in a Sapromat respirometry test using an industrial non-adapted activated sludge inoculum(7). Using a closed-bottle 28-day BOD test protocol, chlorobenzene achieved a 73% degradation classifying the compound as readily biodegradable(8).",

In pond water amended with nutrients and in pond water amended with nutrients and sewage inoculum, chlorobenzene was reduced to concentrations below the detection limit after 12 days incubation; in pond water amended with nutrients and a sewage inoculum, the major product of chlorobenzene biotransformation was carbon dioxide(1). No loss of chlorobenzene was observed in sterile controls(1). The addition of sediment (0.61 g/L) did not significantly affect the biotransformation of chlorobenzene(1). Bacterial isolates obtained from groundwater and soils contaminated with chlorobenzene could mineralize approx 54% of the chlorobenzene within 7 days when supplemented with ammonium and phosphate; 85 and 99% of chlorobenzene added to groundwater microcosms was utilized by 28 days(2). In soil/groundwater microcosms at a former solvent storage site, a 49% reduction in the chlorobenzene concentration was observed over a 1-month period; 42% and 59% reduction in the chlorobenzene concentration was observed in microcosms amended with nutrients(3). A turnover time of 60,731 hours was measured in Lula, OK aquifer solid slurries under aerobic conditions(4). Biodegradation half-lives in not heavily polluted aquifer material were >540 days, 240 to 281 days, 88 years, and >490 days in Oklahoma sandy clay, OK gravel, OK sand, and OK sand, respectively(5). Complete mineralization of chlorobenzene, up to its maximum solubility level, occurred after 3 weeks of continuous operation in a stirred tank bioreactor(6). Results of flow-through column studies using sediment samples collected from sites contaminated by chlorobenzene revealed that chlorobenzene was readily biodegraded when migrating across the sediment/water interface(7).",

An 81.3% loss (half-life of 138 days) of chlorobenzene was observed in sediment samples obtained from the Tsurumi River, Japan over 1 year under anaerobic conditions; in autoclaved sediment, approx 50% loss of chlorobenzene was observed over the  1-year incubation period(2). 82% of the original chlorobenzene concentration was removed during a 47-day study using denitrifying bacteria, capable of degrading a mixture of aromatic compounds, isolated from sequential batch cultures; 60% was converted to carbon dioxide(3). In laboratory microcosm studies, anaerobic biodegradation of radio-labeled monochlorobenzene was demonstrated by mineralization to radio-labeled CO2(4).",

Chlorobenzene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). Chlorobenzene absorbs light in the environmental spectrum between 290-310 nm and may be susceptible to direct photolysis in the trophosphere and in surface water(3). Monochlorobiphenyl has been identified as a photoproduct(4). A photolysis half-life of 21 sunlight days was measured in water(5). Photolysis half-lives of 17.5 hours and 3.80 hours were measured in distilled water and Isar River water, Germany, respectively; chlorophenol and phenol were identified as photoproducts in river water(6).",

A log BCF of 2.65 has been reported for chlorobenzene in fathead minnows(2) that corresponds to a BCF of 450(SRC). A BCF of 41 was measured in bluegill fish (Lepomis macrochirus) over a 14-day exposure period(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these BCF values suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms ranges from low to high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). Dissolved organic matter that is present in interstitial water may greatly reduce the amount of a chemical that is available for accumulation(5). In one set of experiments, midge larvae were found to accumulate higher tissue-to-sediment ratios of chlorobenzene from a low-organic content sediment than from a high-organic content sediment(5). BCFs of 0.25 (from sediment), 11 (from interstitial water), and 10 (overlying water) were measured for midge larvae exposed to chlorobenzene under equilibrium exposure conditions(5). BCFs of 0.15 (from sediment), 310 (from interstitial water), and 5 (from overlying water) were measured for midge larvae exposed to chlorobenzene sorbed to high-organic content sediment under nonequilibrium exposure conditions(5). BCFs of 0.72 (from sediment), 18 (from interstitial water), and 2,187 (from overlying water) were measured for midge larvae exposed to chlorobenzene sorbed to low-organic content sediment under nonequilibrium exposure conditions(5).",

According to a classification scheme(4), these Koc values suggest that chlorobenzene is expected to have moderate to very high mobility in soil(SRC). The sorption isotherm for chlorobenzene onto muck soil (49.0% organic carbon) was linear(5). A Kd value of 166.34 was measured for chlorobenzene using dewatered activated sludge (18% solids) that had been dried and sieved; 3.28% of the chlorobenzene was desorbed during the desorption phase of the  experiment(6). Partition coefficients of 0.35, 0.33, and 0.38 were measured for chlorobenzene on primary sludge, mixed liquor solids, and digested sludge, respectively(7). Sorption coefficients of 0.48 and 0.29 were measured on primary sludge and anaerobically digested sludge, respectively(8). Partition coefficients of 48 and 29 were measured in high organic carbon (14.5%) and low organic carbon (3.6%) Sherman Island sediments, respectively(9).",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that chlorobenzene is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 3.4 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 4.3 days(SRC). Chlorobenzene's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Chlorobenzene is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 12 mm Hg(3). Chlorobenzene applied to soil at a uniform concentration of 1 kg/ha at depths of 1 cm and 10 cm underwent 86.5 and 23.4% loss, respectively, in a day; volatilization half-lives of 0.3 and 12.6 days, respectively, were estimated from this data(4). Volatilization half-lives of 13, 21, and 4.6 days were estimated for chlorobenzene using data obtained from an experimental marine mesocosm under simulated winter, spring, and summer conditions, respectively(5). Chlorobenzene was removed within 8 days in sterile pond water incubated in bottles open to the atmosphere(6). Volatilization rates of chlorobenzene from the wastewater-dependent constructed Tres Rios Demonstration Wetlands near Phoenix, AZ ranged from 5.11X10-6 to 8.48X10-6 sec-1, corresponding to a half-life of approximately 9 hours(7). In a closed aerated laboratory system simulating arable soil exposed to 14-C radio-labeled chlorobenzene, analysis of trapped 14-CO2 and 14-C chlorobenzene gas indicated that volatilization was the main loss mechanism with mineralization having minor importance(8).",

In a survey of 19 small-medium sized municipal landfills in Wisconsin, chlorobenzene was detected in 5 of 113 groundwater samples (max concentration, 16 ug/L) and in 2 of 79 monitoring well samples(2). Well water samples collected over a four-year period from a well on a pesticide plant near Ashdod, Israel were  found to contain chlorobenzene concentrations of 2, 9, 0, and 21 ug/L on 7/1988, 6/1989, 1/1990, and 4/1991, respectively(3). In a study conducted between 1986 and 1989 of the alluvial aquifer of the Sava River, Northern Croatia, chlorobenzene was detected, but not quantified, at three field sites near Zagreb, Yugoslavia(4). Chlorobenzene was identified as one of the 20 most abundant organic constituents in groundwater at 479 U.S. waste disposal sites; chlorobenzene was detected at 86 sites (18%)(5). A study of groundwater contamination at 6 Superfund sites across the U.S. detected chlorobenzene in the Biscayne, FL Aquifer study area, concentration of 30 ug/L, and in the Eau Claire Municipal well field, WI, concentration not specified(6). Chlorobenzene was identified in groundwater samples at a former incinerator site near Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in concentrations ranging from 2 to 300 ug/L(7). In the aquifer of the Bitterfeld/Wolfen region in Germany, a former production site for lindane, chlorobenzene concentrations are as high as 30 mg/L(8).",

The concentration of chlorobenzene in the Besos and Llobregat Rivers near Barcelona, Spain was determined to be 260 and 210 ng/L, respectively; chlorobenzene was not identified in adjacent marine coastal waters(4). Chlorobenzene was identified in an aqueous sample collected near Quantico, VA as having a concentration of <2 ug/L(5). Chlorobenzene was identified in surface water/groundwater samples impacted by municipal landfill leachate in Orange County, Alachua County (southwest), and Alachua County (southeast), FL as having concentrations ranging from <0.20 to 302 ug/L(6). The analysis of 315 water samples collected between February and June 1987 from the municipal water supply of Santiago De Compostela, Spain showed no chlorobenzene present(7). The level of chlorobenzene detected in urban rivers and their estuaries in Osaka, Japan was approximately 0.21 ug/L(8).

Chlorobenzene was identified but not quantified in gaseous volatiles of wastewater(2). The estimated emission of chlorobenzene in Southern Ontario, Canada was 20, 2.5 and 2.5 tons/yr to air, water and soil, respectively, based on 1993 data(3). The calculated emission rate for chlorobenzene from polystyrene foam insulation has been determined to be 0.46 ug/sq-m hr(4). Chlorobenzene was identified in garden waste from Denmark, concentration unknown(5). Chlorobenzene was identified at a concentration of 0.2 ug/L in the leachate of fabric material for collapsible potable water storage tanks(6). Chlorobenzene has been detected in the emissions from new carpet(7). Chlorobenzene was detected in 25% of UK sewage sludges at concentrations ranging from below the detection limit to 1.92X10+5 ug/kg dry weight, mean 3.36X10+4 ug/kg dry weight(8). The mean chlorobenzene concentration in urban UK sewage sludge was 57,300 ug/kg dry weight; the chlorobenzene content in an urban/industrial sludge was 7,010 ug/kg dry weight(8). The concentration of chlorobenzene in a series of samples of sewage sludges from 13 municipal wastewater treatment plants in the Federal Republic of Germany ranged from 5.5 to 153.2 ng/g(8). Chlorobenzene was detected in odor emissions from wastewater pump stations in China(9).",
